The function runs with each command so if you cd too greedily and too deep, the command line input will be on a newline instead of inline. Once you are back at root the prompt will be inline again. Goes by the actual length of the entire prompt regardless of where the text is from. You still see the venv and conda text like normal, which tends not to be the case when PS1 gets edited.

We always talk about supply-chain attacks, but I wanted something that actually stops them without me having to manually check every line of code in every library I use.</p> <p>I called it kprotect, and I finally got it to a point where it&#39;s actually usable (at least on my machine lol).</p> <p>What the heck is it? Basically, it sits in the Linux kernel (using eBPF LSM) and watches which processes are trying to touch your sensitive files. But instead of just looking at what process it is, it looks at the whole lineage.</p> <p>The &quot;Chain of Trust&quot; thing: This is the part I&#39;m most proud of. You can tell kprotect: &quot;Hey, I only trust cat to read my SSH keys IF it was started by VS Code -&gt; Terminal.&quot; If some random python <a href=\"http://unsafe.py\">un",
