Comicstorian is a channel that covers Comic Book content, both new and old. We dramatically read stories, very similar to audiobooks, but for Comics! You can get videos here every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Wednesday will always have a brand new comic that came out that day! Originally, Benny was The Comicstorian, but passed away unexpectedly 6/8/2024, and so his Best Friend and long-time business partner, Dan, has taken up the mantle to read in his stead.\n\nSome of Our Most Popular Playlists!\nAbsolute DC Comics - http://bit.ly/43NXhRu\nFull Stories - htt",
