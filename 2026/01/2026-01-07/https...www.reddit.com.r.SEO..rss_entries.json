New builder here and looking for some practical, current advice.</p> <p>I launched a new site ~2\u20133 weeks ago in the marketing space. It\u2019s not a service business. It\u2019s basically a personal project, an educational site with free, tool-based resources. I\u2019m aiming to compete over time with some of the established players in the category. Terms like CPM, Media Planning, Programmatic, etc.</p> <p>So far the fundamentals feel solid: I&#39;ve got clean technical SEO, 50+ pages of original content, clear niche, no indexing issues. I\u2019m seeing ~50\u201375 impressions/day, a few clicks daily, and average positions around 16\u201320 across core pages. For week 2\u20133, that feels like a good signal.</p> <p>The obvious gap is backlinks. I\u2019m starting from essentially zero, and while I know good content earns links naturally over time, organic traffic is core to my model so I want to be intentional early without doing anything spammy.</p> <p>What I\u2019",
