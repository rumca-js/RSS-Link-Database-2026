I loved the Lucky series and Hollywood Wives books. Were her books on some level trashy? Yes. I still think her books were well written and very fun reads. Also with some of her books dealing with Hollywood it was fun trying to connect the characters with the real actors. </p> <p>3) Robert Ludlum I know his Bourne books are still published and new ones ghost written. I do wonder if younger folks know he wrote more than three novels - Bourne trilogy? The first Bourne novel was good but loved his Materese Circle, Osterman Weekend and Scarletti Inheritance. Althou",

I can read every day, ranging from a few pages to a chapter. The book took me nearly 6 months to read (it&#39;s more or less a thousand pages). </p> <p>I loved it, and I&#39;m really looking forward the next one, but I also like to diversify the books I read and immerse myself in different universes. I tried taking a break in the past on another serie, but then I lost track of the story and characters when I got back to it, and ultimately, lost interest. </p> <p>Would love to hear everyone&#39;s approach for book series!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DaArio_007\"> /u/DaArio_007 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q6fflu/do_you_typically_binge_book_series/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q6fflu/do_you_typically_binge_b",

What is He trying to say to us? through all his work, what is that? do you know? Rather ask yourself: why do you love White nights that much? Is it because it&#39;s short, easy to read, about love, or it has deeper reasons? It&#39;s not about that. It&#39;s about our deep desire that exists in each one of us, but about which we are afraid to speak loud, so we let Dostoyevsky to speak instead of us. Yes, it is magical reading that kind of story where you dive deep into your heart and soul, but what makes life alive is going out of a book and speaking the words you learnt there out loud. I feel like speaking about this book more, only by myself, doesn&#39;t make sense...it is so so so profound that i feel i would disrespect it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/turtle_on_the_shore\"> /u/t",
