I&#39;d like it to know to find same pictures that only differs in resolution. I have thousands of pictures and there&#39;s a lot of duplicates and smaller resolution versions. Another thing I&#39;d like it to know is to find all pictures by watermark. Let&#39;s say I have \u00a9www.example.com watermark in right bottom corner and I want it to find all pictures with this watermark. Even better if it can search thing with prompt, like let&#39;s say I&#39;ll tell it: &quot;find me all pictures with cigarette and house key&quot; and it will find me pictures that have cigarette and house key in it. Or I tell it find me pictures with this and that watermark. Thank you all for a patience with newbie.

They are down to kilobytes in size and are thus shells of themselves.</p> <p>What could have happened? Could it be the age of the drive causing them to fail? Why did they all fail all at once?</p> <p>And should I be concerned about my html and PDF and JPG files now?

YT AV1 was never great, and I can easily see more details with VP90 files. yt-dlp did download some VP90 files before, but mostly AV1 files.</p> <p>Anyway, I noticed that there is a file size difference between the old VP90 files and the newly downloaded VP90 files. All my older VP90 files have higher bitrate than the newly downloaded files. I used to think that YT is using poorly configured AV1 codecs, but now it seems they are also re-encoding their VP90 files with lower bitrate. I wish I knew this before; I was happily getting the AV1 files thinking they have better quality.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/manzurfahim\"> /u/manzurfahim </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q63obm/yt_is_reducing_bitrate_on_vp90_files/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

My plan was to use the drives in my current Synology (4) and add in another spare (Elements) 12TB drive I had plus I bought 2 new Elements 12TB drives to fill the NAS. I&#39;m just now realizing the speed of all my existing drives is only 5400RPM. If I add in these two new drives (which most likely will end up being 7200RPM) will it be an issue?
