While the lineup is expected to launch in 2028, following the rumoured unveiling of the 20th anniversary iPhone models next year, its specifications and features have started surfacing online. Apple will reportedly acquire the 200-megapixel CMOS camera sensor from Samsung, as Sony\u2019s technology could not meet Apple\u2019s requirements. This would be a significant upgrade over the iPhone 17 Pro series, which features a triple 48-megapixel rear camera setup.",
