It then changed course, changed its name, and re-registered as a Russian vessel. It has historically transported Venezuelan crude oil but is reporting to be empty at the moment.\n \nIt has since been pursued by US authorities across the North Atlantic, and Russia has reportedly deployed a submarine to help escort it across the ocean.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#US #Venezuela #BBCNews",
