One example I\u2019ve seen mentioned is Lookr, which seems to take more of a topic-based routing approach.</p> <p>From a search-engine perspective, I\u2019m curious:</p> <ul> <li>How common is this routed or meta-search style architecture today?</li> <li>What are the main advantages and limitations compared to maintaining a full index?</li> <li>Are there specific use cases where this approach makes more sense than traditional indexing?</li> </ul> <p>Interested in hearing how people here think about these different models.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
