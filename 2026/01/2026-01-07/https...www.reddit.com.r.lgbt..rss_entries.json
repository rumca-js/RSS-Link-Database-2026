If you haven\u2019t already, please sign to support! As long as you\u2019re over 18, you can sign it, you don\u2019t even have to be from or in New Zealand. </p> <p>I\u2019m aware the petition has already been shared in many LGBTG+ spaces. That was when it only needed 5,000 signatures. Between then and now, it hit so many goals, now there are 10,000 signatures needed. </p> <p>I\u2019ll post this in other subredddits for awareness, and it would be a huge help if you could sign and share it too.

We\u2019re very close and I sorta have a crush on them but know better bc yknow the lesbian bit, but I have a problem. Whenever they talk about women in a romantic or sexual way it really makes me uncomfortable. Like in a visceral way. I am not sure where it stems from. Maybe being from a far right religious background makes me prudish, or it\u2019s some deep seated homophobia or transphobia, or it\u2019s just plain misogyny but I hate it. I hate thinking negatively about one of my best friends in such a gross way and it feels worse bc I like her a lot. I just want to know how to stop being so fucking psycho and love her for who she is, and not who society expects her to be. I don\u2019t want to be the problem, I just want some way to change my thoughts. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZXS667\"> /u/ZXS667 </a> <br/> <span><",

I\u2019ve also never really admitted I\u2019m Bi expect to maybe my little sister and lowkey I think my dad and other sister knows as well bc the closet is quite see through. For context, my family is always making light hearted jokes that I\u2019m a lesbian. It\u2019s just lately I\u2019m not sure if that is a joke anymore. I genuinely think I am and I am not sure what to do. </p> <p>I\u2019m in a 2 year relationship with my bf and I think he knows I\u2019m a little fruity but I feel like a fraud.
