It would be great if the panel could be portable too. </p> <p>The lines of lyrics don&#39;t necessarily have to scroll, they just need to appear one after the other. </p> <p>I had a look at some of the premade options that are readily available, IE phone controlled panels on amazon, but these seem to have a lag/ a loading animation between different lines of texts, so that wouldn&#39;t really work if I was filming in real time.</p> <p>It seems the other alternative is to go the fully custom route with a raspberry pi and a adafruit LED matrix.

And because of fairly heavy mechanical movement that this circuit will have to withstand, using a USB-C for power is not possible (or at least very inconvenient). So I tested whether I could power the CM5 by connecting 5.1V directly to the 5V rail of the IO board (which according to the documentation is the same that the USB uses to power the CM5) and when I press the power button, the two LEDs on the IO board light up for a split second but it does not turn on. How can I fix this? I even tried applying 400mV to the one of the CC pins on the USB-C connector, but still no. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AvgGalliumEnjoyer\"> /u/AvgGalliumEnjoyer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1q6l3iy/power_cm5_without_usbc_in",

I&#39;m picturing an ecosystem with a motherboard, much like we get for AMD and Intel CPUs, with RAM and PCIe connections, and a separate upgradable ARM CPU. An initial spec could be 4x the cores of a Pi 5 but taking advantage of the much larger cooling capacity of a desktop PC to push the frequency way up.</p> <p>With Apple moving entirely to ARM and now Windows laptops shifting that direction, the market clearly wants power-efficient ARM CPUs. AMD and Intel won&#39;t give it to us, and Broadcom seem to be allergic to making anything that isn&#39;t embedded. There are no real European alternatives in any class, as of yet. </p> <p>What does everyone think to that as a general concept?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",
