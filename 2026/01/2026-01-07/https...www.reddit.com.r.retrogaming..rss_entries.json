I bounced off some titles because of how poorly the UI aged in them. Mainly it was old RPGs - ADD from NES, Breath of Fire 1 AMD few others. </p> <p>Than I played Adventures od Dizzy and the simplicity of interactions was great - didn&#39;t age that much. </p> <p>So my question for You is - what are some Retro Games that UI You could gradem as good by today standards. The more complex game - the better. I mean games that You could give a 10 years old to Play without needing a manual, or lenghtly How To Play YT video. Something like ALTTP, Chrono Trigger, Pokemon Games etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fizolof1989\"> /u/Fizolof1989 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q6drk5/retro_games_with_ui_that_didnt_age/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",

I now have a love and appreciation for ice skating, and I&#39;m going to learn to roller skate soon too. All that out of the way, I was wondering what kinds of roller skating and ice skating games that are retro are worth playing? I have that itch I need to scratch, both types of skating are constantly on my brain. So some good games would be right up my alley. Thanks everyone. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PuzzleheadedSlide904\"> /u/PuzzleheadedSlide904 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q62dzh/goodsolid_roller_skating_and_ice_skating_games_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q62dzh/goodsolid_roller_skating_and_ice_skating_games_on/\">[comments]</a></span>",
