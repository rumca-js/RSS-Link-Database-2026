For a bit of background, I am based in London, UK, I worked my way into InfoSec via my previous company, started as an IAM analyst, moved into security architecture doing some engineering/consultancy around M365 security within our corp environment and now moved companies looking after day to day operations/engineering of some very specific solutions. </p> <p>Long story short, I am very passionate about IAM, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all heard about Zero Trust, Identity as the control plane, xyz. IAM is an area where I see more demand for over the next 5 years and I believe I am going to focus the next phase of my cyber security career in IAM (working my way into architecture). Obviously there\u2019s a big shift with AI, post-quantum computing etc, but I\u2019ve read a lot about GRC roles flooding in (depending on region). I\u2019m intrigued to see what people from other backgrounds think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

In most environments: Endpoint DLP (EDLP) is designed for user endpoints (laptops, desktops). Network DLP (NDLP) covers data exfiltration over network channels (HTTP/S, SMTP, FTP, etc.). For servers, there are usually: No interactive users Controlled ingress/egress Predefined service accounts and application flows</p> <p>So in many cases, NDLP + strong network controls (egress filtering, proxy inspection, TLS inspection where applicable) seem sufficient.</p> <p>However, I can also see scenarios where server-side DLP / data monitoring might make sense: 1. Application servers handling regulated data (PII, PCI, PHI) 2. Insider threats via service account abuse 3. Data staging on servers before exfiltration 4. Shared servers used by multiple teams or workloads 5.",
