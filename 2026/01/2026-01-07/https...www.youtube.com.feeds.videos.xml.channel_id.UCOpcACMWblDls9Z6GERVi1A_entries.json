        "description": "It's time for Beast Games Season 2 on Amazon Prime, so we had an excuse to put the world's biggest YouTuber in the hot seat to discuss everything from tax-evasion to making Jurassic Park for real. We dive deep into the Beast Games, A/B testing breakfast, and the secret burner accounts he uses to argue with 12-year-olds. Watch until the end to see if we successfully bribe Jimmy to delete his channel for forty bucks and some teriyaki sticks.\n\n#mrbeast #beastgames",
