We have tickets opened for Microsoft that haven&#39;t been closed for years. Windows experience basically sucks now. Every new update is aimed to fix some issues from previous versions, while introducing new ones. Adobe is charging you now cancellation fees too? You no longer &quot;own&quot; games you bought with your money? Buying is not owning?</p> <p>The same can be said about open-source too although I have seen open-source is quite quick in fixing issues. If they don&#39;t, you can just fork it, fix it on your own and continue using it. You can even pay/donate developers a coffee amount, ask them to fix it on priority and they&#39;ll fix it for you in less amount of time.</p> <p>I get it",
