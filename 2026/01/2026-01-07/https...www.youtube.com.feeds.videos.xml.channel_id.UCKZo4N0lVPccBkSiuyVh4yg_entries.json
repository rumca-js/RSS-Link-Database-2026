We examine flying motorbikes, broomsticks, Thestrals, magic carpets, Floo Powder, dragons, and even some of the wizarding world\u2019s rarest magical creatures..\n\nThis is the one Hagrid question that never gets answered on the page\u2026 \nuntil now!\n\nSpecial Thanks to @jakob_henkel for this video suggestion!\n\ud83e\udd86\u2615 Ducks go in cups.\n#SuperCarlinBrothers #HarryPotter\n\nWritten by: J & Ben Carlin\nEdited by: Isybelle Christley\n\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Through the Griffin Door LIVE Tour \u2014 Southwest 2025\nhttps:/",
