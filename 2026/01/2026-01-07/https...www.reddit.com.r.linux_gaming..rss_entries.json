I have been using it for battle .net and also Mods like Age of the ring, all in one BFME launcher and they all work flawlessly Using Proton GE no weird lutris scripts. So far it seems to be running better than on windows! </p> <p>one thing to keep in mind when running mods like all in one BFME is you usually need to run the installer then go back and have it run the .exe in the prefix folder. And also open firewall ports to be able to join games in Starcraft.</p> <p>Any way Shout out to the devs. I can now play my random obscure games with friends that I never would&#39;ve thought would worked.

I have recently had the urge to switch from Windows to Linux, and I have a friend group that enjoys playing Call of Duty and Fortnite. However, I know Linux doesn&#39;t support the anti-cheats used, but I&#39;ve heard the term &quot;dual-booting,&quot; and I was curious what that is, and if that is how I could still play with my friends while still having a mainly Linux-based system.

It happens in Witcher 3 only on DX12 after 5-30 min playtime, while on DX11 it runs flawlessly. Also I use Shadow of the tomb raider demo just for benchmarking and it does not have Linux native support like the full game, and my driver crashes in the main menu always on DX12, on DX11 I have no issues. If I limit the frames to 120 in SOTR for example it does not crash in the main menu on DX12. I first thought it is something wrong with my GPU and I tried those games on Windows but did not have any problems there, so it is something with the Linux Drivers. Anyone else is experiencing the same with other AMD cards (RDNA 2,3 and 4) or is it just RDNA 1 issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",

Before Torvalds sudo rm&#39;s my soul from my body, I bought the 5070ti a little while ago before I fully committed to making the permanent switch to Linux. So far my experience with the card has been pretty solid. I&#39;ve had some weird experiences, but nothing too unmanageable. Performance seems fine, but I dont have any solid data to compare against Windows.</p> <p>I have the opportunity to trade the 5070 for a 9070xt +$100 cash (to me). Should I seal the deal? Obviously AMD is generally the better bet for Linux, but it seems like (in my uneducated opinion) that NVIDIA is starting to step up their Linux driver support. Plus, NVIDIA seems to be releasing some cool new features like DLSS 4.5 (I know people hate frame-gen and other AI game features, but both NVIDIA and AMD are pushing the tech, so it&#39;s worth considering).</p> <p>As far as my use case, I&#39;d mostly use the card for playing demanding single-player games at ",

I have an older gaming PC (Intel Core i5 4690k, GTX 970, 16 GB Ram, 512 GB SSD) that has been gathering dust, and it can&#39;t be updated to Windows 11 so I&#39;m hoping to breath some new life into it by switching it over to Linux for gaming, but I&#39;m not sure if it would actually make sense to go through the effort of that if it wouldn&#39;t really work all that well. I don&#39;t play a ton of modern games, but I am deeply intrigued by the fact that I might be able to play my Steam library again since I only have an M1 Mac right now and can only play about 1/4 of my library. </p> <p>I was considering either Bazzite or Nobara as my distro, but if there&#39;s a different recommendation that works better with older hardware, I&#39;m happy for the recommendation. It looks like my graphics card would work with Bazzite, but I&#39;m still very much a Linux noob so I&#39;m happy to learn more. </p> <p>Thanks so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",
