I have seen this book being recommended in this sub quite a lot. And on paper this is a great book for me, I love space operas and I really loved the world in this one. The setting, the different races and factions all worked really well! And really liked most of the main characters but there is one that just makes me kind of hate the book and that is Idris. </p> <p>He is the maybe the most unenjoyable character I have ever read. He is so whiny and has like no redeeming qualities (<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">except saving the world I guess</span>). I know that there is an explanation in world to why he is the way he is but god it is tedious to read. His chapters are also the ones with the most bloat. For almost every one of his chapters there is the same similar description of the unreal and by the second book I wanted to scream to the author that I get",

I often see it mentioned alongside and in discussions about Malazan (which I utterly hated), and having gotten 170 pages into the book dear god am I seeing why. It&#39;s nowhere near as bad as Malazan IMO, because the plot and prose are at least comprehensible so far and I can somewhat feel engaged with the characters, so there&#39;s at least that.</p> <p>But holy sweet baby Jesus on a Harley, does it ever give Malazan a run for its money when it comes to reading like it&#39;s written in a foreign language! It feels like there&#39;s been hardly a single page where a new name, term, place or other proper noun hasn&#39;t been introduced. And it causes the prose to devolve into complete gibberish on so many occasions that it&#39;s legit harming my ability to get into the story.
