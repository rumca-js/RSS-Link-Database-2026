It felt like there was basically no player interaction and I felt like I was building my game while barely paying attention to the boards of other players. It&#39;s a very pretty game, but it was very boring to me and I found myself playing on sort of auto-pilot mode and wanting to drop out of the session halfway through, something that had never happened before.</p> <p>That said, I was looking up Terraforming Mars and apparently, it&#39;s also described as an engine building game. Does it feel similar to Wingspan in that regard, or does it have more player interaction? I&#39;m afraid of buying it and finding it too dull. Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: As a parameter, I recently played Power Grid for the first time and while it isn&#39;t centered around direct competition, I feel like it&#39;s interactive enough as an eurogame to make it interesting.</p> </div><!-- S",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I know its not a common game but theres not much info about it online even though it was probably the most played game in my house growing up. </p> <p>You start with 2 backhoes and a bulldozer and build a construction company, each time around the board is one year. You have little vinyl stickers for the machines and you can auction and rent your equipment to other players </p> <p>If anyone HAS played this game, can you explain how the bidding works? Theres not much in the manual about it. Some spots say &quot;competitive bid&quot; and whoever has the equipment and can do the job starts it at 1000.</p> <p>I figure if multiple people want the job you just keep throwing money at it til someone loses. Then is all that money the job payout? Doesn&#39;t really make much sense though to pay someone else for a job you arent doing.</p> <p>I tried asking my parents about it they said they just skipped that part lol </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by ",

The main reason is that my girlfriend and I had an opportunity to play Tend by IV Studios, and after getting through the teach and the first couple of rounds, we found the flow of the game to be very entertaining. My girlfriend is not as much of a gamer as I am, she loves playing them with me but isn\u2019t always willing to play the heavier weight games, so when I heard she liked Tend a lot I was a bit shocked but thrilled. If anyone has good recommendations for games that are similar to Tend where you get to do your own thing with simultaneous turns, please let me know!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive-Eye1783\"> /u/Apprehensive-Eye1783 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1q645jk/roll_and_write_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span",
