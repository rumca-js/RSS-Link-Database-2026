The server is proxied through an external VPS for internet access. We periodically run into issues where services crash or start lagging, and I need a convenient solution for monitoring their status and viewing logs.</p> <h1>What I&#39;ve Researched</h1> <p>I consulted with an AI (Perplexity) about the optimal monitoring stack. We ended up with the following FOSS-based solution:</p> <p><strong>Proposed stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li>OpenTelemetry Collector \u2014 collecting metrics and logs from podlets</li> <li>Grafana \u2014 web dashboard panel</li> <li>Loki + Promtail \u2014 log storage and indexing</li> <li>Prometheus \u2014 metrics collection (uptime, restarts, resources)</li> <li>Kestra \u2014 orchestrator for automating reactions to events (alerts, auto-restart, etc.) (btw Kestra is a key interest for my friend)</li> </ul> <h",

I (partially) understand what LFS is for in this regard, but I&#39;m still fuzzy on it.</p> <p>My understanding is that LFS allows you to manage large binary files separately from your codebase to avoid bloating your Git project with multiple revisions of the same Jpeg. But is there a point to this when your codebase and binary library will be on the same server, probably in the same share?</p> <p>Does LFS offer other advantages I&#39;m not aware of?

I&#39;m finding that I basically have to use a custom domain (which is fine as I have one) and have something like Caddy or Nginx (separate instance from my already existing one for non-VPN services, because it should only bind to VPN IP range) to manage SSL and point the relevant subdomain to the right service and a custom DNS server for the VPN connection so that my subdomain which points to the service hidden behind VPN resolves to the Wireguard IP, instead of my public IP.</p> <p>This setup works, but I&#39;m wondering if this is actually necessary or if I missed something and am making it overly complicated. Can anyone running Wireguard share their setup if you have something better than this?</p> <p>And before you suggest it, yes I&#39;m aware of Tailscale, which is very popular here, but would like to avoid relying on a free 3rd party hosted ",
