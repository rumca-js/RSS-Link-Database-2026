        "description": "Bariatric surgery far outperformed GLP-1 weight loss drugs in a new real-world comparison of more than 50,000 patients. Two years after treatment, surgery patients lost about 58 pounds on average, while those using semaglutide or tirzepatide lost roughly 12 pounds. Even patients who stayed on GLP-1 drugs for a full year saw much smaller results than surgical patients. High dropout rates and real-world challenges appear to blunt the drugs\u2019 effectiveness.",

        "description": "Researchers in Japan built a miniature human brain circuit using fused stem-cell\u2013derived organoids, allowing them to watch the thalamus and cortex interact in real time. They found that the thalamus plays a decisive role in maturing the cortex and organizing its neural networks. Signals from the thalamus triggered synchronized activity in specific neuron types, while others remained unaffected. The system closely mimics human brain development and could transform how scientists study neurological disorders.",

Some people inherited the virus directly in their DNA, passing it down across generations. The study shows that these viruses evolved alongside humans\u2014and that one strain eventually lost its ability to integrate into our chromosomes. It\u2019s the first time this long, intimate relationship has been proven with ancient genetic evidence.",

The material heats up under a magnetic field to destroy tumors, while its bioactive coating helps it bond to bone and stimulate healing. Tests showed rapid formation of bone-like minerals, a key sign of successful integration. The breakthrough could lead to smarter, less invasive treatments for bone tumors.",

Deaths have also climbed to over 10 million a year, with the steepest increases hitting low- and middle-income countries. Without urgent action, researchers project more than 30 million new cases annually by 2050. Alarmingly, around four in ten cancer deaths are tied to preventable risks such as smoking, poor diet, and high blood sugar.",
