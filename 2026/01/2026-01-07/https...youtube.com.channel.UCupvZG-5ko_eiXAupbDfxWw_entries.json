Check out our guide to CES 2026 for our latest hands-on impressions right from the show floor.\n\nWhen I saw the new LG Wallpaper TV\u2019s impressive design at CES, I remembered why I look forward to this convention every year: It challenges my expectations and makes me rethink what I thought I knew about technology. This improbably thin television looks to be LG\u2019s answer to Samsung\u2019s lauded The Frame Pro by offering an art TV experience with LG\u2019s top OLED display technology. If that\u2019s not enough to get you excited, here\u2019s why I\u2019m actually enthusiastic about an art TV and why I think it could be one of the best TVs of the year.\n\n\nCheck out the full article:\nhttps://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/electronics/lg-wallpaper-tv-hands-on\n\nCheck out our more of our CES 2026 coverage:\nhttps://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/ces-2026\n\nCheck out our other review",
