Feedback from multiple project leads is that she works quite slowly and often doesn\u2019t ask questions when she doesn\u2019t understand something. I\u2019ve already had conversations with her about this, but there hasn\u2019t been much improvement.</p> <p>Management is now losing patience and plans to put her on a performance improvement plan. I want to support her as much as possible through this.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for advice on two things:</p> <ol> <li>How can I best help and support someone during a PIP, especially when I\u2019m not working with them day to day?</li> <li>Management wants the PIP to include clear milestones. What kinds of milestones would make sense the issues that they&#39;re facing?</li> </ol> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NerdyVinci\"> /u/NerdyVinci </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/develop",
