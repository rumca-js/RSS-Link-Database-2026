I&#39;ve considered Brave and Firefox, but I was just wondering if any of you guys had any suggestions, tips, or recommendations? Mostly, I just want to make sure I choose a safe &amp; reliable browser, but I&#39;ll be honest, I don&#39;t know a ton about browsers.</p> <p>I mainly use the internet to stream movies, do research, or use discord. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important to know when choosing a browser, but still, I thought I&#39;d inform you guys js in case :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FreeLoveForEveryone\"> /u/FreeLoveForEveryone </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1q6um2h/choosing_a_better_browser/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1q6um2h/choosing_a_better_b",

Every time it happened, I\u2019d head to the Chrome Web Store looking for an extension to block them, but I never found anything that actually did the job. Most times, I\u2019d just give up and move on.</p> <p>Recently, it happened again, and I finally got fed up. So I decided to fix the problem myself, which took me weeks of constant development, but I eventually did.</p> <p>Today, I\u2019m excited to introduce <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mccbghhcnnakalkomkgdmdeecbaalmpg\">Search Enhancement Suite</a>. It solves the exact issue I started with (which I know many of you deal with too) and goes way beyond that. You can block sites, highlight important results, favorite and save links, enable infinite scrolling, and much more.</p> <p>The extension is completely free and built for everyone looking for a peaceful search experience.</p> </div><!-- ",

While this is true for simple page loads, intensive rendering tasks are a different story.

Firefox, on the other hand, always runs buttery smooth no matter what kind of hell is taking shape in the viewport. Don&#39;t let the trolls fool you into doomerism.
