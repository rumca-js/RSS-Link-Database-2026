In the past, they were rare treasures, and eating them felt just like eating candy. When fully ripe, the fruits fall with a gust of wind, and children would wait beneath the trees, guarding that moment of sweetness.\nBeyond being eaten fresh, they are also used in cooking:\nSoaked in liquor, they\u2019re sweeter than honey; simmered in soup, they\u2019re more fragrant than red dates.\nThis homely, knobbly, \u201csweet-in-its-own-ugly-way\u201d fruit \u2014 often likened to a little chicken claw \u2014 is a seasoning treasure quietly kept by Yunnan mountain families beside their hearths.\n\nHello, everyone!
