This partisan gridlock previously caused the longest government shutdown in US history, a 43-day crisis that showcased the system's paralysis. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has intensified, not healed, these divisions, creating factions even within his own Republican party. The traditional two-party structure appears broken, with personal attacks often replacing governance. The national motto, \"E Pluribus Unum\" (Out of Many, One), now stands in stark contrast to the current reality of political dysfunction.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna reports from Washington, DC. \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: ht",
