Perhaps he will reflect that he has already made his first misstep since leaving Strasbourg. He elected not to sit in the away dugout, leaving Calum McFarlane in interim charge after the draw with Manchester City, and the result was Chelsea producing a directionless performance in which they lost Marc Cucurella to an early red card before losing to a late goal from Harry Wilson.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/07/fulham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

On the penultimate day of an Ashes tour packed with regrets for England, a star was born when Jacob Bethell, 22 years young, raised his bat to all corners of the Sydney Cricket Ground in celebration of a hundred that offered hope for the future.</p><p>There was no reason why England should collapse to defeat on this sun-soaked fourth day but every reason to think they might anyway. Ground down by Australia over two months, starting their second innings 183 runs behind and with Ben Stokes injured first thing, they certainly looked ripe for it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/07/bethells-elegant-first-test-century-presses-pause-on-australias-ashes-party\">Continue readin",
