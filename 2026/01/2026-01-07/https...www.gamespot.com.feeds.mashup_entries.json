SteamOS works far better than Windows on these machines, and fortunately, it's available on another device: Lenovo's Legion Go 2. The company recently rolled out the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6534509/\">Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, but for anyone looking for a handheld with more heavy-duty hardware--and Switch-like controllers--the Legion Go 2 has been a solid option. Lenovo will start selling the Legion Go 2 with SteamOS preinstalled in June, with pricing starting at $1,199.</p><p>Preorders aren't open at the time of writing, but it's likely that you'll find a listing at Best Buy and Amazon soon for the Legion Go 2. Compared to other PC gaming handhelds, the Legion Go 2 offers a lot of technical bang for your buck. The premium model is powered by the AMD Z2 Extreme",

Free Roam mode lets fans explore the open world of the game, but someone at AGDQ has demonstrated how to turn that into your personal playground.</p><p>A speedrunner named Helix went through Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode to complete the All ? Panels category in under 30 minutes. The goal is to activate every single question mark block in the game. To pull that off, Helix needed to pull off a lot of tricks, as well as some lucky breaks, and judicious use of the game's rewind feature.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ATxMOTKWzg\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ATxMOTKWzg\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" scrolling",
