        "description": "Scammers came up with new tricks to watch out for.\n\nIt's more important than ever to be diligent and on the look out for scams. Scammers no longer just try to steal a little from you anymore, they'll steal the shirt off your back if you could. This year's video is longer than the previous ones but I also talk about more scam variations. Some are more widespread than others, but I think seeing as many varieties of scams as possible can help you spot new ones you haven't come across before. Because even new scams usually use some fundamental strategy that's been around forever. So if you can learn to spot the commonalities, you'll be even better protected.\n\nHere's the iOS shortcut I mentioned for toggling silence unknown callers: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/afdeb37ff3c24b0486e65a3e238ee744\n\nTime Stamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:20 - Expiring Points Scam Text\n0:46 - Scams Targeting Specific Professions\n2:15 - Calendar Invite Scam\n2:50 - Brushing Scam New Twist\n4:12 - The \"I Paid Twice\" Scam\n5",
