        "description": "What if changing how people see you wasn\u2019t about changing yourself but about changing the moment? Laura Huang reveals how small moments of \u201cdelight\u201d can flip perceptions, disrupt biases, and open doors to opportunity. Using her research in behavioral science, she shows how anyone can turn adversity into advantage and create an edge. \n\nLaura Huang is a professor at Northeastern University and a leading expert on how perception and interpersonal dynamics shape success in entrepreneurship and leadership. Her research explores how individuals can create an edge\u2014even in the face of disadvantage\u2014by turning adversity into advantage and shaping how others see their value. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
