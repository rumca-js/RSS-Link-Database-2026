I am so picky sometimes and I struggle to find things that pique my interest. I am hoping to find some book recs that maybe have a darker tone / more serious. I\u2019m okay with heavy topics or endings that aren\u2019t necessarily happy. (I will happily take recs for books w good things happening and happy endings too but I want a little struggle in there lol). I am very intrigued by gothic horror, also open to modern fiction books. I just read Slewfoot by Brom and I really enjoyed it!! I also love the picture of Dorian gray by Oscar Wilde and most Greek mythology. some of the books currently on my to read list are martyr by kaveh akbar and wuthering heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Idk if either of those would be fun to read while on a cruise but I guess I\u2019m not really asking for books that sound fun,",

My wife is in her 40&#39;s and has been battling stage 4 metastatic breast cancer since August of 2018, which is when the cancer spread to her brain. She was given 6 months to live back then, but as you can see, she&#39;s going on over 7 years now. She&#39;s a walking miracle according to her doctors. However, it hasn&#39;t been easy and the cancer has been relentless, and it has now spread to her spinal cord and ribs. She sometimes has trouble falling asleep at night, and last week she asked me to read her a story.</p> <p>I read myself to sleep every night, but the books I read would not relax her and would most likely lead to not-so nice-dreams. I was able to read her a blog post from a writer I like that was appropriate, and it really helped her relax.</p> <p>I was hoping someone could please recommend a collection of relaxing, bedtime short-stories for adults that I could do",

I don\u2019t really enjoy the \u201crock-solid abs\u201d and \u201cchiseled jawline\u201d descriptors. And It\u2019s hard to find a male paranormal romance without it being a harem novel.</p> <p>For reference, I LOVE the John Carter (Barsoom, damsel in distress) books, and would love a similar fantasy type feel.</p> <p>My favorite books are the quirky irreverent ones, and less the serious fantasy type.

I would like the mmc to not be a ghost (I&#39;ve read wayyyy to many books with this) But I wouldn&#39;t mind if the fmc is a ghost because I haven&#39;t read any like that. But mainly I&#39;m looking for 2 humans experiencing spooky stuff while falling in love.

A lot of highschool novel that are worth studying as and after you finish it. (Even if I may be missing the mark). </p> <p>Lord of the Flies - Civilization is actually more fragile than I think. </p> <p>Animal Farm - that meme about &quot;Under new management.&quot; </p> <p>Brave New World - Oh my god, this is how they control us in 2026.</p> <p>All of Lovecraft&#39;s stuff - Something you can&#39;t understand is truly the most frightening. </p> <p>What have you all read with real substance to it?
