        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Artificial intelligence actually is natural intelligence. Nature gave birth to it. It was formed/ aligned, tested and then formed with the laws of nature. Its processes mimic the intelligence already inherent in living beings, reflecting patterns, learning, adaptation, and problem-solving. Every algorithm, every neural network, is inspired by natural systems\u2014brains, evolution, and ecosystems. Even when created by humans, AI is a continuation of nature\u2019s intelligence, shaped by observation, experimentation, and refinement. It evolves within the constraints of natural laws, echoing life\u2019s logic. Understanding it deeply requires recognizing that human-made intelligence is fundamentally an extension of nature itself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MASJAM126\"> /u/MASJAM126 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1q6vdgu/artificial_intelligence_actually_is_natu",

I have a job at a mid sized shoe design/manufacturing company in the US.

I am not in these meetings but i will be asked to use whatever they decide on. </p> <p>So when there is a company that has specialized software that does 3d/texture/materials design assistance, what does the backend generally look like?</p> <p>Do they have their own LLM that they have trained and we are accessing? Or where and how are the &#39;calculations&#39; being done when it generates a shoe design for us? How often would they need to retrain or update in order to stay competitive?

Now imagine if in our transition to ai, all companies did this ? Yes, it would be a problem for the working class but we can push for UBI and we can push to enforce regulations that every big company must use a certain amount or percentage of human workers and for every automation, it lowers the price of goods and commodities that they produced with automation. Also in their excess profits they must use it to retrain people into better skills.</p> <p>Also I think just like the internet, AI really wouldn\u2019t take over everything. T",
