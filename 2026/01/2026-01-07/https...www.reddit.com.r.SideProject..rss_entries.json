Turns out LinkedIn is the only platform right now. Jobs tab is the go-to page for job seeking. However she told me that some of the job posts are shared as regular posts. And thanks to their algorithm it&#39;s impossible to see the same post again. Once you miss, you miss it forever.</p> <p>I built a Chrome extension for her in a weekend. To track some people or companies for job posts, and classify them. Then thought it might be helpful to any job seeker. So, I published it.</p> <p>The extension is free, because I believe it&#39;s unfair to ask money from someone who is in need of a job. I&#39;m planning to keep it that way. </p> <p>Free extensions either show ads or sell data. I&#39;m against that. No ads.</p> <p>It&#39;s privacy first, your data doesn&#39;t leave your browser.</p> <p>I tried to keep configuration very simple. </p",

The goal is to help listeners answer: \u201cWhat is this song actually doing inside me?\u201d instead of just \u201cdo I like it?\u201d 2. Expressive Copy Layer (shareable text) Each tr",

But I kept hearing about RocketMoney and I wanted to see if I could create a lightweight version but for Rewards/Points programs.</p> <p>Basically the app take a look at a finacial statement (you can upload photos or files, or just take a photo with your phone).</p> <p>It then runs it through a few LLM&#39;s and generated a list of all the Rewards/Points programs you could qualify for. It also estimates savings.</p> <p>The full report is paywalled but it actually will generate a small analysis for free.
