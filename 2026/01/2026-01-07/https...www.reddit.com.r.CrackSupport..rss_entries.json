First, I\u2019ll list everything I\u2019ve already tried, and I kindly ask if anyone has an idea of what else I can do. My setup is: RTX 5080, Ryzen 7 9700X, B850M Aorus Elite, 2x16GB G.Skill 5600MHz, and an ADATA SSD. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried so far: Downloading and placing the .dll files into System32 and SysWOW64 Changing the virtual memory (page file) size Running the installers with a RAM limit Running the installers in compatibility mode Downloading and installing Windows updates Cleaning Temp and %Temp% folders Changing the number of CPU cores used at Windows startup Installing some Windows packages (I don\u2019t remember the exact names, but things like C++ redistributables, etc.) Do you have any other suggestions for a solution?

I&#39;m usually pretty good with computers but I haven&#39;t been able to turn this laptop on for like a year so I didn&#39;t play or update the game at all. Now the computer works but the game doesn&#39;t lol. For reference, I&#39;m on windows with a legit basegame and cracked dlc from anadius (who I hope is at peace in internet retirement).</p> <p>At first the offline cracked game launched but it kept crashing constantly. Opened the EA app and it wanted updates so I let it update. Now trying to open the cracked game gives me this error. &quot;Unable to start: The contents of your user data directory were created by a newer version of The Sims 4 and cannot be loaded. Please update your game through Origin to play.&quot;</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked for answers and none of them have changed the result so I come to beg reddit for a new and specific solution. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",
