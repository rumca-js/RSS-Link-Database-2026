        "description": "Revisiting Resident Evil Outbreak in 2026 makes it clear that this was not a misguided experiment but something that was ahead of its time. Few survival horror games, even today, commit so fully to vulnerability, cooperation, and restraint. When viewed from a modern-day lens, Outbreak stands as a reminder that horror is often most effective when it limits the player rather than empowering them. \n\nIt may not have received its due in 2003, but in the modern landscape of co-op horror, its influence and ambition are impossible to ignore. It\u2019s still not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, and most players would probably give up on the game on account of those tank controls and brutal survival horror mechanics \u2013 but those who stick with it in the long run would be able to appreciate its strengths.",

        "description": "Among a suite of upcoming action-adventure games is Longevity: Yin and Yang, a title from studio 11 Games that blends precise combat, tactile puzzles, and fluid traversal, presenting a game many are referring to as \u201cSoulslike\u201d. Now, comparisons with FromSoftware are fair, if a little obvious - blades, fantasy, mystical worlds, Longevity certainly drops in this camp. But, there\u2019s much more hidden detail in its action; there\u2019s patience, measured pace, movement, and poise. \n\nThis feature delves into Longevity's gameplay, centring mostly on combat, as 11 Games\u2019 effort demands study. This brand of combat is calm, deliberate, and precise, yet executed with lethal, tempered aggression. If you\u2019re interested in technical yet rewarding action games, then you\u2019ll need to keep your blades sharp for this one.",
