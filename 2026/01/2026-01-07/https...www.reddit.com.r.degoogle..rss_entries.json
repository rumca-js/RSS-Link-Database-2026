It runs android 11 go which made it impossible to install microg, at least I couldnt manage it, even when I used root access from adb shell and masked everything to .replace, I still got a duplication error. I gave up after spending hours on it today. My goal? Get WhatsApp running. I know &quot;defacebook&quot; but I have tons of groups I need to be a part of. I installed WhatsApp via aurora store. Then came the part where I would give my name and it would do its thing. But it got stuck on a &quot;connecting&quot; screen. When I long press on the WhatsApp icon it shows all my groups, I called myself from another phone, calls work. But its still stuck after rebooting, changing to mobile from wifi, wifi from mobile, staying on airplane mode for a while, turning off the battery optimization. Everything. Nothing works. I tried to install the app version instead,",

However with their new AI focus and honestly pretty bad app start times, I was not really impressed so maybe a week ago I switched to Waterfox because a few people in this sub seemed to like it and omfg I love it. Load speeds are so much faster and there&#39;s just no bs. I&#39;m considering switching on desktop but the past two Firefox based browsers I&#39;ve used on desktop just had random web apps which didn&#39;t work well and I&#39;m not really a fan of having a &quot;backup browser&quot;.
