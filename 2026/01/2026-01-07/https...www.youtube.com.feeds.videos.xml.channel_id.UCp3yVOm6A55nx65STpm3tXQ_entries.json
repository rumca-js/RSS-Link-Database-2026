But it wasn't until 2018 that I finally found a trackball that completely replaced mice for me... The Elecom HUGE is the perfect combination of comfort, ergonomics and customization, and I've never looked back. But as good as it was, I've been wanting some more modern features in my ancient mouse tech, like 3-mode wireless, a replaceable cable, and better bearings for the trackball itself. That want is finally a reality with the new Elecom HUGE Plus.\n\nBut first...
