Over the weekend I started feeling nostalgic so I wanted to create some new stories.</p> <p>I wanted something <em>new</em> in the anthology style, so I decided to experiment with AI. Going in, I expected the stories to be fairly mediocre. I ended up using Google\u2019s Gemini to create a <strong>choose-your-own-path anthology story generator</strong>, and I was honestly surprised by the output. Some of the text \u2014 and even the images \u2014 genuinely put a smile on my face.</p> <p>I wanted to share it straight away, but realised that people would need their own Gemini API key if they wanted text, images, and narration to come from Google.
