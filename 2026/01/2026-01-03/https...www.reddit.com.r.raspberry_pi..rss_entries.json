Setting up the C++ toolchain (CMake, arm-none-eabi-gcc, SDK paths) is often the biggest barrier for beginners, and maintaining it across different machines can be a pain.</p> <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> PicoForge is a self-hosted, browser-based tool that lets you visually design your firmware using blocks.
