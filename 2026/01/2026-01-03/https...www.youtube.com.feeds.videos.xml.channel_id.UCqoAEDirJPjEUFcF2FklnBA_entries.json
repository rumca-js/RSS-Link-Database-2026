        "description": "Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions Chuck Nice, Gary O\u2019Reilly, and the StarTalk Team have been saving all year about gravity as a force, cosmic rays, free will, emergence, and how physicists decide which equations to apply. \n\nWhat was Neil\u2019s favorite non-astrophysics topic from the past year? Chuck asks: Is gravity really a force, or just the bending of spacetime? Neil unpacks Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle, curved spacetime, acceleration versus gravity, and why it may not matter which explanation you prefer.\n\nAre cosmic rays causing airplane computer glitches? Are particles from deep space really to blame? Neil explains cosmic radiation, solar activity, space weather, and why redundancy, not blaming the universe, is the real solution. Why does the strong nuclear force grow stronger with distance? How do gluons interact with quarks to create protons and neutrons? \n\nHow do physicists choose equations? Neil breaks down the real value behind problem sets and building up y",
