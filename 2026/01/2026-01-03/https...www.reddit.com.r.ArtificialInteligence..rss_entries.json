They type something in, &amp; hope it understands the shape of the answer in their head, and feel disappointed when the output doesn\u2019t match what they imagined. But AI doesn\u2019t respond to expectations, it responds to clarity. The difference between frustration and leverage is learning how to externalize intent. When you slow down just enough to describe what you actually want, constraints, tone, purpose, audience, and nongoals, the interaction changes. The system stops guessing and starts aligning. What looks like \u201cAI getting smarter\u201d is often just the human getting more &quot;precise&quot;. And that precision, not the tool itself, is where the real capability lives.

But now not only do newer gpus not only cost thousands of dollars and everything relies on AI for upscaling *cough dlss4* and not offer any new true performance uplift without AI and input delay, but now we also gotta deal with ts for ram and it is seemingly affecting storage too. What&#39;s next are we gonna have to start renting clean air because of AI data centers causing pollution? like i&#39;m gen z and iv&#39;e already accepted that im fucked and will never afford a home but like bro could I at least have my gaming pc be somewhat modern so I can enjoy my unreal engine 5 slop game with my 5090 slop ",

By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected im",
