The main character is the son of an evil queen dark lord, with a mystery as to who his father was. He&#39;s going on a quest as a part of his coming of age, and all of his older siblings who went on the same quest have died. The evil queen&#39;s nation is a typical Mordor-esque evil place, surrounded by good nations. There are bits of flashbacks to his siblings being killed, and at one point the MC communions with his older sister through a mirror. The quest involves the MC trying to raise his own army - I believe he rescues a love interest at one point as well. I think in the end he shows an attitude for &quot;good&quot; magic as well. </p> <p>What on earth is this book? I have no idea if it was part of a series, but it s",

But I&#39;ve noticed a trend with the last few heist books I&#39;ve picked up. They all start with &quot;The Job&quot; and the first two thirds of the book are all about the con/heist, but then by the end of the book, it becomes some kinda heroic save the city plot. Ill try to avoid specific spoilers, but The Lies of Locke Larmorra by Scott Lynch, Six of Crows &amp; Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bardugo, Mask of Mirrors by M. A. Carrick, and Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson, they all do this. They start with some really cool and really engaging con artist tale, and by the end the plot turns from pulling off &quot;The Job&quot; and pivot more towards stopping various big bads before finishing &quot;The Job.&quot; It feels like a minor tone shift that irks me. It&#39;s like if in the middle of Ocean&#39;s 11, the gang had to stop the Chinese",

Compared to some of you, I know that&#39;s way low, but I&#39;m hoping to gradually increase that number. This year was my most successful reading year by far: I read 13 whole books and one graphic novel (which some may not count, but I&#39;m counting it because it&#39;s my list).

I&#39;m interested in a recommendation for a book set in a frozen wasteland, as the title says, a vibe similar to the game Frostpunk.
