        "description": "Scientists may have cracked the case of whether a seven-million-year-old fossil could walk upright. A new study found strong anatomical evidence that Sahelanthropus tchadensis was bipedal, including a ligament attachment seen only in human ancestors. Despite its ape-like appearance and small brain, its leg and hip structure suggest it moved confidently on two legs. The finding places bipedalism near the very root of the human family tree.",

        "description": "The brain constantly blends split-second reactions with slower, more thoughtful processing, and new research shows how it pulls this off. Scientists discovered that brain regions operate on different internal clocks and rely on white matter connections to share information across these timescales. The way this timing is organized affects how efficiently the brain switches between activity patterns tied to behavior. Differences in this system may help explain why people vary in cognitive ability.",

        "description": "Time-restricted eating has been widely promoted as a simple way to boost metabolic health, but new research paints a more complicated picture. When calorie intake stayed the same, an eight-hour eating window did not improve insulin sensitivity or cardiovascular markers. What did change was the body\u2019s internal clock, which shifted based on meal timing and altered sleep patterns. The results suggest calorie reduction, not the eating window itself, may be the real driver of health benefits.",
