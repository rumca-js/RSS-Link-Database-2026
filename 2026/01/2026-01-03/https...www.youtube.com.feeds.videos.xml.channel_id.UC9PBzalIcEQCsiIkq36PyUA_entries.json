Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nIt's Oliver's turn to revisit his personal favourite games of 2025 - and perhaps not surprisingly for a man with well over 400 games in his Switch 1 collection, it's Nintendo's brand-new console hybrid that completely dominates the selection.
