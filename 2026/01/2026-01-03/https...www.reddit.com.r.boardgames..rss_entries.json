Organize the game pieces to make set up a breeze. Put all player components in the same bag (e.g. all color tokens, starting cards/resources) and give players a choice of bag.<br/> 6.

Overkill is very good idea, since it provides players with variety of choice rather than just move-attack.</p> <p>Space cadets also use action point system and oxygen mechanics. Oxygen gets spent on some special actions, or to do extra actions, or can get lost thanks to enemy attack. It is valuable extra resource, but no oxygen = you dead. </p> <p>Unfortunately there is not a lot of variety, since game never received planned expansion: just 6 enemy types in total, and you will usually encounter only few of them during mission.

I want people to care about winning or not losing, without stressing anybody.</p> <p>One idea I considered is a tiny buy-in (everyone chips in a small amount and the winner takes it), but I\u2019m hesitant because some friends could argue that it feels like gambling, even if it\u2019s mostly symbolic. I\u2019ve also seen fun alternatives like a traveling trophy the winner keeps until the next session, or a \u201cchampion\u201d photo/crown tradition.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s worked for your group: rewards, funny consequences, seasonal leaderboards, achievements, anything along those lines.

The delicious evilness of the turn programming in DSOG scratches an itch for me that no other game does. <strong>RIP Chad Jensen, you were an</strong> <strong><em>awesome</em></strong> <strong>designer.</strong></p> <p>HOWEVER... the DSOG even in its latest printing looks like complete ass. I get that GMT games are often basic looking by design, but DSOG is not a counter-based wargame, it is a highly thematic game where you are simulating evolution, it deserves a refresh. DSM is a later version of this game and looks so, SO much better and in my opinion it adds a lot to the game. However, it is only max 4 players which makes DSOG still highly relevant.</p> <p>So please GMT, if you are reading this (and you will, because",

It started out as just a fun project, but it became so much more. It logs when games are played and who wins, then uses that information to calculate useful statistics that show patterns over time. The program can also help with choosing what to play by filtering and suggesting games based on things like group size, play time, and what hasn\u2019t been played recently. Along the way, it keeps a running history of game nights so nothing gets lost or forgotten. It\u2019s designed to make game night planning easier and to give a clearer picture of how and what your group actually plays. It is actually pretty cool how basically all of this data stems from the GameLog entries. All you tell the program is the date, game played, and game winner name and it does everything else. </p> <p>Let me know if you have any comments, find any errors, or have ide",
