I recently started researching and discovered that I might be demichica or girlflux (more girlflux). I was more or less sure, but once I was with some friends and one of them saw my phone&#39;s wallpaper, which had the queer, pansexual, demichica, and girlflux flags, and asked me, &quot;Why the hell do you have those flags if you don&#39;t know what they mean?&quot; I felt bad and called my mom to pick me up. I had to make up an excuse not to tell her why, but in the end I told her. I told her that I didn&#39;t feel 100% female, that I didn&#39;t like my private parts, etc. Her reaction was that I was confused and that I was mixing things up and that it was just a &quot;phase.&quot; Now she&#39;s really messed things up, and I don&#39;t know who I am anymore. I&#39;m so confused. Please",
