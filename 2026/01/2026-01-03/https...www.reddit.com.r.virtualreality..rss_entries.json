I\u2019ve already tested it and the Meta Quest 2, so I have a comparison. The thing is, my budget is 1000\u20131200 PLN and at that price, looking at used units, there\u2019s practically no chance. Do you have any ideas for other VR headsets similar to that price? I looked at the Pico 4, because resolution matters to me, but people say the foam padding is bad, it\u2019s uncomfortable to use, and the game library is very limited. Then I looked at the 3S, and it\u2019s cool because it already has an RGB camera, a large game library, lots of accessories, but again those lenses and weak resolution like in the Quest 2 don\u2019t convince me. Is there any VR expert here, or anyone who can advise me on what to buy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Agreeable_Data3275\"> /u/Agreeable_Data3275 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments",

But when it worked, I thoroughly enjoyed my time using it. After enough headaches with it I decided I wanted to go into VR proper, so I&#39;m looking for a good headset. I finally have a decent play area too, so this time around I&#39;m not so worried about having a wired headset. Either way I want a headset that has eye tracking. I do plan to mostly use it in VRChat, as well as some miscellaneous games.</p> <p>Currently I plan on getting:</p> <p>- Bigscreen Beyond 2e</p> <p>- UDCAP VR Gloves</p> <p>- VIVE Tracker (3.0) x8</p> <p>- HTC VIVE SteamVR Base Station 2.0 x4</p> <p>- Babble Mouth Tracker</p> <p>- Bigscreen Beyond X1-B Interface Elite Kit (Mixed Pads)</p> <p>- Valve Index Controllers (if they ever restock)</p> <p>And I guess as a follow up, should I go with the Vive 3.0 Trackers or Ultimate?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

It was a long road to reach this point, but it&#39;s seriously a blessing that they made the effort to turn their humongous AAA franchise into a AAA VR game that actually works and feels incredibly immersive. I&#39;ve been playing it nonstop in PCVR the last few days. </p> <p>It&#39;s honestly everything I want out of VR: 38 beautifully rendered and incredibly detailed immersive sim-esque maps, guns and tools that work and feel incredible when used creatively, and to top it all off, the game is still being supported with nearly endless content possibilities. It&#39;s actually hard to wrap my head around just how expansive some of these maps are.</p> <p>There are still quite a few bugs, especially with game launch and Steam VR, but once you&#39;re in the game, it mostly just works. </p> <p>I wish more people would give it another shot. Let me know what you think of the Hitman VR.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",
