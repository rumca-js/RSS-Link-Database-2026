My niece was given one of those handheld emulation consoles, but due to neurological issues she&#39;s facing, she is having a hard time learning how to play. My idea is to record a series of tutorial videos (we live many kilometers away). The format I envisioned is vertical video, with gameplay at the top and controller input visualization at the bottom. For that I need an application that would show controller inputs in graphical form. I should be able to choose controller layout to display to accurately mimic layout of the handheld. Does such program exist? Also, suggestions about video pipeline to automate creation and cutting clips are welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rhoki-bg\"> /u/rhoki-bg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1q2ywfn/controller_input_visualization/\">[link]</a></span>",

The system would just die mid-game, completely reproducible. PSU clicks off, no kernel panic, no freeze, no logs. Just instant death.</p> <p>I&#39;ve had this issue for at least a year, maybe longer. Since I don&#39;t game that much and some games like Anno 1800 always worked fine, I never properly investigated. Naturally I assumed my 800W Enermax Max Tytan was damaged or couldn&#39;t handle 3090 transient spikes, so I ordered a 1200W be quiet Dark Power 14.</p> <p>Strangely, Windows worked perfectly on the same hardware. (I still use dual boot for BF6 sometimes, but also tested Witcher 3.) So did Blender CUDA rendering on Linux at 600W for hours. Only Linux gaming killed it, both native and Proton.</p> <p>Witcher 3 killed my PC once it loaded the game. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 at a specific camera angle",

With laptop stand, air would flow in properly and it never went beyond 80c temperature while gaming. </p> <p>When I switched to linux I had trouble with temperatures over 100c and shut downs. After a lot of investigations and trying out everything I could, I ended up using ryzenadj to make a gaming script which basically set up my tdp to 25w. It gave me more fps than windows and it stabilized my temperatures to around 70-75c. </p> <p>Now if I got this right, it means I basically told my laptop to use fixed ammount of power instead of jumping around, I&#39;ve also set my up max temperature do never go beyond 80c. Is that a good setup that will force fans to spin faster when needed and to deliver optimal power when gaming? </p> <p>So far this has",
