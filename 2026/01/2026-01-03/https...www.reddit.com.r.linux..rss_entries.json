I do a lot of stuff with pictures (mostly panoramas) which takes a lot of RAM. After running out of memory twice, I created a 40GB swapfile and that fixed that issue.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about buying a secondary M.2 SSD to use as a temporary swap, until I can buy the second 16G stick.</p> <p>What are your opinions on this?

What stands out is unlike capturing every event, the binary does in-kernel filtering to ignore certain actions such as `read`, `stat` by users `root` or app users who regularly access those files.</p> <p>In addition to this, when users switch to root/app users to access the files, those actions are captured too. The performance penalty compared to other userspace monitoring tools is minimal as ebpf runs in kernel.</p> <p>This is all configurable via a config file like below::</p> <p><code>monitored_files:</code></p> <p><code>- /tmp/testfile</code></p> <p><code>- /etc/passwd</code></p> <p><code>- /etc/shadow</code></p> <p><code>ignore_actions:</code></p> <p><code>- read</code></p> <p><code>- stat</code></p> <p><code>ignore_users:</code></p> <p><code>- root</code> </p> <p>A sample log trial",
