        "description": "First responder Dena Suihkonen from Minnesota is bringing awareness to the dangers of dunk tanks after a recent accident. She was at a Fourth of July celebration when the dunk tank she was in malfunctioned. The accident burst her T12 vertebrae and caused her spinal cord to be severed, leaving her paralyzed. But her positive mindset has helped her through the healing process. \"We weren't promised that life would be easy,\" she told Inside Edition Digital's Andrea Swindall. To support Dena, visit her GoFundMe: https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-to-denas-road-to-recovery-and-mobility",
