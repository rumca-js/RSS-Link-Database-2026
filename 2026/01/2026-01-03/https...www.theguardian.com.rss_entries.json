As an artistic statement it was prophetic and impeccably theatrical.

And do we want to revisit that place, emotionally?</p><p>Thankfully, Bowie: The Final Act (Saturday 3 January, 10pm, Channel 4) does not live solely in the catacombs.

I cried when Keegan left, but soon a new king was born in my imagination: Kenny Dalglish, that wily, tough, insanely skilful Scot. I travelled the country to follow my team through the peaks and troughs that culminated in the lowest possible low, on 15 April 1989, the day of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.</p><p>There are many things I remember about Hillsborough, some of which returned to me years, even decades, late",

        "description": "<p><strong>Tebay, Cumbria:</strong> Small farms like ours contribute to society, but we need help to survive. A huge cloud has lifted over our future</p><p>Just before Christmas I attended a&nbsp;farmers\u2019 conference near Penrith,&nbsp;which included a presentation on the inheritance tax rules for agricultural land. An accountant worked through an example of a typical hill farm like ours: the bill worked out as \u00a359,000 every year for 10 years.</p><p>Between the farm and our off\u2011farm jobs, we can\u2019t generate that kind of profit, so this terrified&nbsp;me \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what would happen to the farm if we had to pay that bill. We sought advice from a solicitor, but, thank goodness, there was a surprise announcement from the government on 23 December that the threshold on land and assets was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/23/ministers-raise-inheritance-tax-threshold-for-farms-after-backlash\">raised from \u00a31m to \u00a32.5m</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com",
