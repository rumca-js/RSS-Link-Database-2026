        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>An essay about the shift from matrix factorization to LLMs to hybrid architecture for personalization. Some basics (and summary) before diving into the essay:</p> <p><strong>What is matrix factorization, and why is it still used for personalization?</strong> Matrix factorization is a collaborative filtering method that learns compact user and item representations (embeddings) from interaction data, then ranks items via fast similarity scoring. It is still widely used because it is scalable, stable, and easy to evaluate with A/B tests, CTR, and conversion metrics.</p> <p><strong>What is LLM-based personalization?</strong> LLM-based personalization is the use of a large language model to tailor responses or actions using retrieved user context, recent behavior, and business rules. Instead of only producing a ranked list, the LLM can reason about intent and constraints, ask clarifying questions, and generate explanations or next-best actions.</p> <p><str",
