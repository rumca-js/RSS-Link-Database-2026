        "description": "Welcome to THE cursed run of fallout 4. The goal is not to beat the main story. The goal is not to find my son shaun. The goal is not to save the commonwealth. This is Fallout but everyone must die. Put simply if we see a living character be they a raider or Preston garvey (the worlds loveliest gent) we must hunt them down and remove them from the game. Think of me like the fallout universe equivalent of the terminator which feels rather apt in a world filled with dangerous synths. \n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE:\n- All NPCS Hostile\n- All NPCS must die\n- Dont Get Softlocked \n\nWith the new year now in full swing and season 2 of the fallout TV show in full swing now seemed like a great time to throw myself back into this lovely RPG but with a twist. In order to make this work you will need two key mods: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/837?tab=files\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/93579\n\nEverything else is just graphics or gameplay fixes to improve performance so no point sharing them.
