The Skyhawks are showing around 17,000 hours and honestly I\u2019m not totally sure which direction makes more sense in the long run.

Manufactured 2015 but appear to be sealed in bag. Will run an extended smart test on them before loading data. </p> <p>Use case is a NAS server for media (Plex). So mostly read cycles on these and not super frequent either. I\u2019m a relative beginner. I\u2019ve already filled two 6tb drives (running mirrored). Aside from the obvious redundant backup I have to make when I get the money, anything I\u2019m missing? Are these older drives risky, even though they don\u2019t appear to ever have been used?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spoon_In_The_Road\"> /u/Spoon_In_The_Road </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q2ki7r/old_new_stock_hard_drives/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q2ki7r/old_new_stock_hard_drives/\">[comments]</a></",
