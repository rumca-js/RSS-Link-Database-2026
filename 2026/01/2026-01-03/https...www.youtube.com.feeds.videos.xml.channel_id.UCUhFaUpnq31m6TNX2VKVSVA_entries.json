The question is, which Vantage will come out on top? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the stats. \n\nStarting with the V12 Vantage, it was released in 2010, and it\u2019s powered by a 5.9-litre naturally-aspirated V12 that delivers 517hp and 570Nm. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 6-speed manually and the car weighs in at 1,680kg. As of today, it\u2019s worth around \u00a380,000. \n\nUp next is the Vantage GT8. It\u2019s packing a 4.7-litre NA V8, and this produces 446hp and 490Nm. It sends this power to the rear wheels via a 6-speed manual, and it tips the scales at 1,510kg. As of today, it\u2019s worth \u00a3150,000. \n\nThen, finally, we come to the Vantage GT4 race car. It\u2019s powered by the same 4-litre twin-turbo V8 found in the Vantage road car, but the power output is rest",
