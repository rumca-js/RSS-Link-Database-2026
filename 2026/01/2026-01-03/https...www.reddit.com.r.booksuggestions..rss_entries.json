I would love to spread my horizons a bit in terms of what I\u2019m reading, i feel like in the last years i have mostly just been reading books from english speaking authors, including most trending books today. I would love to get some recommendations for books from other countries and cultures (maybe by well known authors where they come from, but not internationally acclaimed, like for exemple Murakami) and i\u2019m up for anything, from classics to contemporary, fiction, fantasy, sci-fi. I\u2019d love to hear from redditors that are not american/British, what is your favourite book from your country?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Existing_Wishbone866\"> /u/Existing_Wishbone866 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q37mwd/books_from_around_the_world_favourite_book_from/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q37mwd",

I&#39;ve ordered a 2nd one in the series. i have not read any other romance books so i can&#39;t compare but i like stuff that is well written, not a cliche trope, convincing passion</p> <p>-Secret History donna tart - a bit different but her writing is amazing </p> <p>What else would you recommend that really captivated you and left you thinking WOW? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FileRegular9",

My favorites this last year were: Between Two Fires, The Library at Mount Char, The Blacktongue Thief (and the prequel), and The First Law series. The things they all have in common that I loved were horror elements (less so in Abercrombie\u2019s stuff), complex characters, avoidance of world building glut, a dash of humor, and really solid writing. I\u2019m struggling to find my next read. I\u2019ve avoided overly long series (First Law is 2 trilogies and standalone stuff), and I think I\u2019d like to stick to stand-alone, duologies , and trilogies. Any recommendations would be appreciated. </p> <p>Note: I started The Lies of Locke Lamora and The Black Company. I could not finish either. I also didn\u2019t care for Abercrombie\u2019s The Devils. It just didn\u2019t have the same depth of characters, and I hate vampires. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/flanneryoshi",

For the past few years, all ive truthfully been reading is the Star Wars novels and fanfictions for a bunch of fandoms lmao. The last book I finished was Wicked and I began Twilight and I&#39;m slowly chipping away at it but I want to move away from the comfort of things I know. I tend to read things that I already know a lot about/are in the fandoms for because due to my autism, its easier for me to visualise and I don&#39;t lose interest since these books I read are all a part of my special interests! But I know there are so many books out there i would enjoy if I gave them a chance, but i just dont know what! So im looking for recommendations of ANY books, ANY genre, that you think i would like based off these &#39;facts&#39; (I guess) about myself: </p> <ul> <li><p>I love video games a lot!! My favourites are The Last of Us, Stardew Valley, Assassins Creed, Red Dead Redemption, Baldurs Gat",

I&#39;ve read some truly amazing books in this time and I am looking to keep the journey going.</p> <p>So I&#39;d like some recommendations to see me through 2026 and 2027. Specifically, I&#39;d like some books that fall into the below categories.</p> <p>Horror books: But I am talking really horror. Something that left you feeling truly unnerved.</p> <p>Murder/Murder mystery: Something that kept you engaged and guessing, that you finished and wanted to read again.</p> <p>Nonfiction/personal accounts: I read &#39;Into thin air&#39; by Jon Krakauer and found it a gripping read. I&#39;d be eager to continue exploring more books like that.</p> <p>In addition, any recommendations are gratefully accepted. Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Landmine_Tosser\"> /u/Landmine_Tosser </a> <b",

I loved the first book but after that the main character (Anastasia) started to annoy me, wish she would stand up for herself more. </p> <p>Then i read Butcher and Blackbird and loved the main female character. She was confident, and snarky and lowkey insane lol. I definitely would like to read something where the female takes more control. </p> <p>Also i just read Praise by Sara Cate. LOVED IT. Very happy i picked reading back up. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional-Sun2249\"> /u/Additional-Sun2249 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q2ispr/bold_female_character/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q2ispr/bol",
