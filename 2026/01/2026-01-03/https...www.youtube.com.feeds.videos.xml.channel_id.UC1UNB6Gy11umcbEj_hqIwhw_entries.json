        "description": "Maotai Zhen feels like a place straight out of another world. The air smells of fermentation, and alcohol shops are everywhere you look. The town is home to more than 1,000 distilleries, including Guizhou Maotai (Kweichow Moutai), the world\u2019s largest spirits producer, where even a small bottle can cost over $400.\nSurrounded by the mountains of Guizhou, Maotai Zhen is surprisingly scenic. Most of the distilleries are built along the hillsides, and as you walk through town, people will casually stop you, offer you a sip of their liquor, and invite you to visit their distilleries.\nIt\u2019s a fascinating place, tucked away in the heart of Guizhou.\nJoin us on this journey to the world's most alcoholic town \ud83c\udfac\n\n0:00 Intro \n1:38 Maotai Town \n4:51 Baijiu History\n9:51 Baijiu (Liquor) Production\n16:20 Final Impression\n\n#moutai #china #guizhou #baijiu #liquor #alcohol \n\nDo you want to see more of our adventures? \ud83c\udfac\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/littlechineseeverywhere/\n\nDo you want",
