I really like games with stories or any element where I keep guessing or think deeply about. The platform, review score, graphics, genre, or gameplay style doesn&#39;t matter. I cant name all the mystery games I\u2019ve played on the top of my head right now, but most likely the famous ones I already did so I apologize ahead of time.

I played returnal as well, blue prince, but not much else of the sort.</p> <p>I really enjoy adventure RPGs and I think that&#39;s the itch that I can&#39;t scratch. So are there bite sized itches? Fun gameplay, good story, a certain level of customization that&#39;s not exhaustive. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t played many souls like games, no elden ring no Skyrim, but I think they&#39;d be too &quot;big&quot; to get into right now.

Within the fromsoft games I have already beat DS1, DS2, and Bloodborne so definitely going to enjoy 3. I did hear though that dark souls 3 is more difficult than those others so I wonder if that\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t find those other ones too challenging overall with the exception of Dark Lurker. Nioh 1 I did find more challenging but it was designed so well IMO that it just worked. That would be my favorite souls style game</p> <p>Bonus if you say the reason why said game has go",
