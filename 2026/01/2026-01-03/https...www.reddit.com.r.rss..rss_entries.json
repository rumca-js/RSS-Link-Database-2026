But YouTube doesn&#39;t recommend any of them.</p> <p>Then, I keep missing the newsletters like &quot;thisweekinreact.com&quot;. My email is flooded with lots of useless emails.</p> <p>What it does:</p> <p>- You only need h,j,k,l to navigate the user interface.</p> <p>- There are other vim keys like g, and G.
