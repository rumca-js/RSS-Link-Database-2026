The band was two different vibes altogether. The best example is Fleetwood Mac, but their lineup change was what really made them two separate bands. Here\u2019s my theory: more often, you can like both versions of the band only if you liked the later version first. My dad loved Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green but HATED Fleetwood Mac without him. I love REM\u2019s first 5 records, but I don\u2019t get anything afterwards. BUT, I theorize that if I got into REM 2, I could have gone back and liked REM 1. But it rarely works the other direction. Two questions: 1. What are other bands what have two or more periods that are ENTIRELY different? 2. Is the theory sound?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/National_Property583\"> /u/National_Property583 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1q372wq/a_theory_on_b",

It feels like the music succeeded in working its magic, of taking me to feelings as only music can.</p> <p>One of mine is in Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#39;s song &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; during the third verse:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Sail on, silver girl</em></p> <p><em>Sail on by</em></p> <p><em>Your time has come to shine</em></p> <p><em>All your dreams are on their way</em></p> <p><em>See how they shine</em></p> <p><em>Oh, if you need a friend</em></p> <p><em>I&#39;m sailing right behind</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I get the chills during the words &quot;sailing right be-&quot;...
