        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Dear all,</p> <p>I encountered a few problems when using AGA V3 on the Steam Deck: 1) I think something is wrong with the sound. The sound is different/worse from how I remember it when playing Amiga in the early 90s. 2) When I am switching to C64 on the AGA, the controls do not work. I think I also have a sound/lag issue here.</p> <p>I installed emudeck on a microsd. Could my problems have to do with this? Btw. what is the correct AGA version to download? I downloaded the version for RetroArch. And one last question: is there a kind of AGA version for C64?</p> <p>Many thanks. I am new to the emu game.</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Obvious</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Obvious_Fly_9008\"> /u/Obvious_Fly_9008 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1q2pxrz/amiga_game_selector_steam_deck_set_of_questions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comment",
