Rather than trying to go back and forth with it, I decided to try out some other clients instead. So far:</p> <p>- qBittorrent does not have such issue, but it does not seems to have scheduler - which is required for me</p> <p>- Transmission has not really user-friendly UI</p> <p>- Deluge seems to lack deep network configuration options such as disablement of uTP protocol which is also required for me, or requires some plugins to be downloaded and installed and messed around with which I don&#39;t really feel like bothering with either</p> <p>Looking further I seem to only find some ad-infested garbage or stuff that barely works/looks horrible.</p> <p>Are there",
