It also makes the second half of the game a lot harder, and I had a lot of fun grinding a lot preparing for just how hard it was going to get. The big conversation between the party and the last boss at the end of game really brought me back to the 90s in a very good way, and I really glad that I screenshotted every single line. It also was a lot of fun losing to the last boss for the first time in my life(Beat them the second time.)

Wreckfest and Rocket League for me (no association) felt like games that allow my inner child to be curious about what is possible, be fascinated about the imaginary world, and really enjoy it. </p> <p>What games are like that for you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FifthBison\"> /u/FifthBison </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q2uuf6/what_modern_games_conjured_up_the_same/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q2uuf6/wh",
