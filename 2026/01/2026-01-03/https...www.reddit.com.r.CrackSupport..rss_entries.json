Not my first time playing but my first time playing on PC with better specs than console etc.</p> <p>I wanted to play with DLCs and store content. The game does have cheat engine tables to give you the items etc. but they only work with the fully paid versions of the game (i.e. not game pass/uplay). </p> <p>Since I don&#39;t like to give Ubisoft money (why else would I be here :D) I downloaded the fitgirl repack version of the game which includes the DLCs but quickly found out that my official version saves (GameVer 1.5.6) don&#39;t work with the repack (1.5.3) </p> <p>I don&#39;t really want to lose this save so is there a way to either 1) downgrade the save to work with 1.5.3 or 2) start a save in 1.5.3, give myself the gear then transfer that stuff to my official 1.5.6 save? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ReeceReddit1234",
