After Rust got it&#39;s Warhammer DLC pack, I&#39;ve gotten intrigued and started doing some minor research on the franchise. The entire franchise feels like Starcraft on steroids, then I learned that Starcraft was heavily inspired by Warhammer.</p> <p>However, I&#39;m deeply confused on how to even start getting into this gigantic franchise. There are so many board games and video games, it&#39;s genuinely daunting.</p> <p>Please help. I would like to get into this franchise via Video Games before I venture into the board games. A simple Warhammer search on Steam gives me 30+ entries lol, I have NO idea which game to get.</p> <p>Which video game is the &quot;perfect&quot; entry to the series? A game that explains the lore and the factions and overall what this universe is all about.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",
