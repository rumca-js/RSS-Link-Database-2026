The paper companies are all run by foreigners, Solar paper got bought out by Americans, they give them gifts(eel sign of potency and reproduction) and then abandon them ruthlessly. The moon paper\u2019s obvious Japanese connection, you can be rich but you\u2019ll be alone because you chose greed (attention, money) over connection, the guy lives in a literal island. Papyrus is a company with Chinese boss, constant distraction that keeps poking at your weakness. And Korea only survives by killing his own countryman (north vs south). I could keep going on and on. This movie was one of the most calorie dense movie I have seen in a while. I actually liked it better than The Parasite.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UGLGG\"> /u/UGLGG </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

I loved the movie, but I feel like the supporting characters really elevated the movie. </p> <p>Mister Terrific was great. Especially the scene where he helped Lois rescue Superman. The music was a bonus - perfect. </p> <p>Nathan was as perfect as Guy Gardner. I never expected that. He made the perfect comic book to film. Hope we get more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MurderBot1126\"> /u/MurderBot1126 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1q0xnfr/what_was_your_favorite_movie_of_2025/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1q0xnfr/what_was_your_favorite_movie_of_2025/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I consider the Star Trek reboot trilogy, especially Star Trek (2009) to be among the very best action movies made in this IP era. The reviews seem to agree with me on this but (admittedly anecdotally) they have seemed to have next to no cultural impact, especially compared to some of the great IP movies of the last 15-20 years including Nolan Batman, Iron Man, James Bond etc. Almost nobody I know (I\u2019m in my early 20s) seems to have watched them and I never see them referenced in social media. IMO these movies are outstanding popcorn flicks with the right blend of nostalgia for existing fans and genuine quality for newcomers. My question is am I wrong to put these movies in the class of the others I mentioned or if not, why do they seem to have made 0 dent to popular culture.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Top_Use2413\"> /u/Top_Use2413 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comme",
