On chain, everything worked. Off chain, nothing did. The web app entered an infinite login loop.</p> <p>After writing a pile of diagnostic scripts, I realized what had happened.

The linked Github repository is the source code in BASIC for a program my dad wrote to help himself when he was building custom speaker enclosures back in the late 80&#39;s to early 90&#39;s. After some tinkering with DosBox I was able to run the program using QBASIC. It works just like I remember!</p> <p>So if you are new to programming, and you want to see how we did it back in the day, take a peek! Or, if you are an &quot;old pro&quot; and just want to walk down memory lane, you might appreciate this.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adampresley\"> /u/adampresley </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/adampresley/michael-presley-speaker-program\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1q0u3hv/thanks_dad_for_the_in",

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.</p> <p>The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database\u2014GraphQLite adds Cypher&#39;s expressive pattern matching on top.</p> <p>You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.</p> <p>Hopefully some others find it useful! </p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/colliery-io/gra",
