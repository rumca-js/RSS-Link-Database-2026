I also don&#39;t plan to use an old PC that I already own, as I&#39;m concerned that its power consumption is quite high and I think that the fan for the CPU no longer works. Furthermore, the price of old PCs in France, even second-hand ones, remains high compared to the price of the parts I need for a Raspberry Pi NAS.</p> <p>I plan to use a Pi Zero 2 W with an Ethernet + USB HAT, with a 250 GB SATA SSD.

When I plug in the official 27W power supply, the Pi powers on and the LEDs look fine, but the fan just doesn\u2019t spin at all.</p> <p>What\u2019s confusing is that if I unplug the main power and connect only a USB cable from my laptop to the Pi, the fan starts spinning. As soon as I plug the normal power supply back in, even if the USB cable is still connected, the fan stops again.</p> <p>There\u2019s no storage connected right now. No SD card and no SSD. I was planning to boot from an SSD, but the PCIe ribbon cable was missing from the box, so I haven\u2019t been able to test that yet.</p> <p>Just trying to figure out if this is expected behavior when there\u2019s nothing to boot from, or if the fan should spin as soon as proper power is applied regardless.
