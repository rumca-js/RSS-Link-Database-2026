I was a Hey Arnold! fan through and through, and something about anime never really interested me. I did have a fascination with the Japanese language, but learned it via other media/sources. I can now follow Japanese fairly okay and noticed I understood a lot of <em>Dandadan</em> (which I clicked on by accident last year on my Netflix!). I got hooked, but I think what got me was a weird &quot;Hey Arnold&quot; vibe from the main characters, plus the added bonus of the Japanese learning source. I&#39;m finding myself wanting to explore more anime with a good romance plot. Also, for those who speak Japanese, I&#39;d love to know of any anime that uses more &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;real-life&quot; Japanese? Anything is fine, though! And manga is okay too! </p> <p>I&#39;m limited to Netflix for now. :( </p> </div><",

In Apocalypse Hotel, the plot kicks off with a toxin making the air unbreathable for humans called \u201cinfortunium pollution\u201d \u2013 a term literally meaning misfortune or calamity \u2013 that kills off the vast majority of humanity\u2026 actually, scratch that. The plot kicks off sometime before then, when a blonde gentleman with a red star on his upper left cheek and a striking mustache builds the hotel, purchases its robotic staff, and opens it to paying customers. </p> <p>If you don\u2019t remember his name, you are correct! He\u2019s just listed as \u201cOwner\u201d on <a href=\"https://anilist.co/character/359328/Owner\">AniList</a> and <a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/character/268543/Owner\">MyAnimeList</a>. Yet, none of this would exist without him, and despite never appearing in the present day, he hangs over the plot ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>5ch (the successor to the (in)famous 2ch) is perhaps one of the most well known Japanese internet forums out there, and their two decade old AOTY voting has always been an interesting peek into specific anime fanbases with interesting tastes to say the least. The current format has people required to vote their top 5 anime of the year and with explanations of why they like each of them, so it\u2019s more than just vote &amp; click! Each vote leads to 1-5 points each for anime depending on the ranks.</p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/yuu_k_1101/status/2006382415661633549\">https://x.com/yuu_k_1101/status/2006382415661633549</a></p> <p>Personal opinion: It\u2019s unfortunate that my absolute favourite <strong>BanG Dream! Ave Mujica</strong> missed out on capturing the crown for Girls Band Anime for the 4th year in a row, but a 4th (2nd by people voting it as AOTY) is definitely still great given absolute extreme opinions on it from certain fan bases!
