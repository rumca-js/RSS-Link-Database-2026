I love documentaries so I\u2019m thinking maybe nonfiction would be better to try. I would prefer shorter books to start. Any suggestions?

I&#39;ve always found the most success with shorter stories bc honestly a good book never stopped me from never finishing it. I buy lots of acclaimed novels I fully intend to read, get two chapters in, and by the next chance I get to read again I have no idea where the story left off. I realize this is blasphemy to hardcore readers. Meet me where I&#39;m at. I need short. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/high5scubad1ve\"> /u/high5scubad1ve </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q16yf5/need_a_recommendation_for_short_stories/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q16yf5/need_a_recommendation_for_short_stories/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Also due to the dependency on the audio/visual means for literally everything has ruined my wiring and now somehow I don\u2019t like to read anything except for newspapers or some study/work material that isn\u2019t available in this mode. I think my brain has started to treat it like some real workout and I tend to give up easily when can\u2019t comprehend what\u2019s written. Starting this year I want to change this and start reading again. I am thinking of reading one book per month initially until I get in that zone again. I purchased Life at the Bottom yesterday, beginning with that now but I would be forever grateful if anyone of you could suggest me books that I can read throughout this year and please make suggestions according to my situation I have mentioned here in the beginning of this p",

I also do not like the cozy subsection of the genre, mostly because they spend too much time describing the surroundings. So a fast paced cozy mystery is fine. I used to love Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series as a kid. so if you know something similar but for adults, then that would be perfect.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fish_is_not_a_pet\"> /u/Fish_is_not_a_pet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q0r22z/help_me_pick_murder_mysteries_that_are_not/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q0r22z/help_me_pick_murder_mysteries_that_are_not/\">[comments]</a></span>",
