        "description": "Impact investor Tom Chi challenges a dangerous assumption: that economic growth and ecological health are opposing forces. He reveals how advances in AI and robotics are enabling a radical shift towards innovation as a force for restoration. Imagine mines that extract less, farms that regenerate soil and fleets of robots that can plant 100,000 mangroves in a single day. What if the same technologies that power our economy could actively repair the planet at the same time?
