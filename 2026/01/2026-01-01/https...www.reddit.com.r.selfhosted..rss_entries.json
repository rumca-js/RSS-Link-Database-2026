I need to use existing directories on a NAS. I looked at Szurubooru and Danbooru and while they look like they&#39;d meet my utility needs, it seems as though I&#39;d have to upload my images again when I already have a bunch of images organized into folders with existing tags. And I&#39;d need to continue use of those folders in the existing structure for other applications.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the last few months building <strong>Orion-Belt</strong>. It\u2019s a secure SSH/SCP bastion system designed for teams who need to manage infrastructure without opening a single inbound firewall port.</p> <p><strong>The problem I wanted to solve:</strong> Traditional bastions are either too simple (no auditing) or too complex/expensive (enterprise PAM tools).</p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong> It uses <strong>Reverse SSH Tunnels</strong>. Your servers (behind firewalls) call <em>out</em> to the Orion-Belt server. When you want to connect via <code>osh</code> (the client), the gateway routes you through that tunnel.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>ReBAC:</strong> Relationship-Based Access Control (No more &quot;all or nothing&quot; access).</li> <li><strong>Session Recording:</strong> Every keystroke is recorded for audit/replay.</li> <li><strong>Temporary Access:</strong> Built-in &quot;request/",
