        "description": "Around 40 people are  known to have been killed and 115 injured in the fire that tore through a packed Swiss bar filled with New Year revellers.   The blaze began at around 0130 local time at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, high in the Alps in south-west Switzerland.  The region is a tourist and skiing destination popular with visitors from across the Europe and beyond. \n\n60 survivors are being treated at hospital in the nearby town of Sion.  Others have been transferred to hospitals in other Swiss cities. A doctor at Geneva University Hospitals said patients are suffering from severe, third degree burns and the effects of breathing in smoke.  He said many of the patients were \"very young... between 15 and 25 years old\".  A significant number of those injured are in a critical condition\n\nSome witnesses have said that birthday candles or flares carried on top of champagne bottle set fire to the ceiling, starting the blaze.  Videos show fire spreading quickly across the bar\u2019s dim",
