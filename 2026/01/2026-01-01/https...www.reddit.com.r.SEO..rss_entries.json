And maybe this is the wrong sub for this, but, my partner recently cheated on me and left for with a dude who owns an online business with a relatively strong SEO presence in a smallish city. If I hypothetically wanted to tank their ratings and make Google suspicious of their site in a petty way, (or make it difficult to manage their site) how could you do that? I&#39;m only good at growing SEO not tanking it without being the site owner, haha.
