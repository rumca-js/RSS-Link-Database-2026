To promote my new book, 221B Reboot, I decided to move past traditional marketing and build a functional tool.</p> <p>The Project: The 221B Deduction Engine uses vision-based AI to analyze user-uploaded photos of personal spaces (desks, shelves, entryways). Instead of just labeling objects, it uses a custom prompt framework to apply deductive heuristics, interpreting wear patterns, item organization, and environmental &quot;clues&quot; to infer the subject\u2019s habits and personality.</p> <p>The Goal: I wanted to see if I could use generative AI to bridge the gap between a fictional character\u2019s brilliance and a real-world user experience. It\u2019s been an interesting experiment in &quot;Transmedia Storytelling&quot;\u2014using an app to let the reader live the protagonist&#39;s",
