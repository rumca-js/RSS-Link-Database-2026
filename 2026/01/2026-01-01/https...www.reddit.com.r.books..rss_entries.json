It was a set they did to celebrate their 80th anniversary and it&#39;s collection of 80 little books (probably around by 6 inches and maybe an average of 50-75 pages). It came out around 10 years ago and I think was originally priced much higher, but now you can get new sets online for around $80. It takes up some space but it&#39;s so nice to just have a curated set of quick and interesting reads to just pick up when you&#39;re looking for something. It&#39;s also a format that could really only work physically because browsing is a big part of the fun. </p> <p>As for the works they choose I thought they did a good job.
