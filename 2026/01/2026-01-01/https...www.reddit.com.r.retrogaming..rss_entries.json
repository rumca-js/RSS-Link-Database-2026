A store I frequently said that a worker at a landfill found it and brought it to him. The store owner didnt want it so glady took on the project. There is no way of know how long its been out there but it looks like is been a while. I&#39;m going to try to refurbish it as much as I can. Looking at it, I think the board is trash but the case is definitely save-able. I&#39;ll update you with the finished job or any other photos if you want to see them.
