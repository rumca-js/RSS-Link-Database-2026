        "description": "Being active boosts your daily calorie burn more than previously thought. Researchers found that increased physical activity raises total energy use without triggering the body to conserve energy elsewhere. Basic functions keep running at full speed, even as movement increases. The result: exercise truly adds to your energy output rather than being metabolically \u201coffset.\u201d",

        "description": "Scientists studying Alzheimer\u2019s in African Americans have uncovered a striking genetic clue that may cut across racial lines. In brain tissue from more than 200 donors, the gene ADAMTS2 was significantly more active in people with Alzheimer\u2019s than in those without it. Even more surprising, this same gene topped the list in an independent study of White individuals. The discovery hints at a common biological pathway behind Alzheimer\u2019s and opens the door to new treatment strategies.",

Orbiting a city-sized neutron star, this Jupiter-mass world has a bizarre carbon-rich atmosphere filled with soot clouds and possibly diamonds at its core. Its extreme gravity stretches it into a lemon shape, and it completes a full orbit in under eight hours. Scientists are stunned \u2014 no known theory explains how such a planet could exist.",

These gains don\u2019t fade \u2014 they grow over time, bucking a long-standing trend in early education research. Even better, Montessori programs cost about $13,000 less per child than traditional preschool. The results suggest a powerful, affordable model hiding in plain sight.",
