No footage of IRL stuff, only games. The only &quot;me&quot; thing would be my own voice.</p> <p>I would also go the extra mile and create a separate email adress just for the channel that doesn&#39;t use any of my regular ones as recovery so nothing would be attached to me (I believe).</p> <p>I have to add to this the fact that I don&#39;t have any personal social media, only profiles like this one and one on instagram to see memes, I don&#39;t have any online contact with people I know IRL aside from messaging apps. They don&#39;t even know about my meme account, as far as anyone is concerned",
