No headset, no game engine, just a browser.</p> <p>The idea is simple. Point to hover. Tap air to click. Open palm to grab and rotate. Your webcam tracks the hand, and the browser responds.</p> <p>Right now I&#39;m focusing on things like 3D product demos and interactive spatial landing pages. The hard part is making it feel natural, not gimmicky.</p> <p>Curious how people here feel about hands as a first-class input mechanism for the web. Does this direction make sense, or is it solving a problem nobody has?</p> <p>Still actively building this. If you want to check out what I&#39;m working on and maybe join early testing, I&#39;m collecting feedback here: <a href=\"https://theomnexu",
