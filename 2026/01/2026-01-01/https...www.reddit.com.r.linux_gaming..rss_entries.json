Or does each game have dependencies stores elsewhere on the OS that would break the game? </p> <p>While I have everything setup and working with my games, it took some time with a few of them to dial in the wine settings, etc. to get them to run.

Recently I have been wanting to host a linux server for multiple different games and one of them is Ark Survival Ascended, however ASA doesn&#39;t have official linux server support. So I searched the internet for a solution and stumbled across a reddit post on this subreddit for a script for hosting and managing an ASA server on linux through Proton which can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Zerschranzer/Linux-ASA-Server-Manager\">here</a>. However no matter how hard I try I can&#39;t seem to get it to work. I have the logs for the server crash but due to my inexperience I can&#39;t quite determine what the problem is or how to fix it. Can someone provide some insight on what the problem might be and how do I fix it?

Journalctl showed a driver crash, specifically a &quot;ring gfx_0.0.0 timeout&quot; error.</p> <p>Many people said it was a driver problem, but I found it strange since it only happened in this specific game (maybe it is and this is just a workaround, but still)</p> <p>After trying everything I found out that the problem was with the crappy Resident Evil 2 DX12 implementation, and that explained why I never encountered the problem any other RE Engine title.

Generally the game performs fairly well especially in outdoor scenes however I have noticed that indoors there is sometimes light source &quot;pop in&quot; where the game will hallucinate and forget V is indoors and act as if there is no roof allowing sunlight in, and in this clip you can see the game is switching between light sources as I walk along the hallway with the large window, sometimes letting light in from the window and other times not. Additionally there&#39;s the matter of the very obvious artifacting in the room with the elevators, not seen in the room at the start of the recording. I noticed this only happens when the game is using Path Tracing (used in video) or any of the ray tracing presets and none of these problems occur when ray tracing is off.</p> <p>I&#39;m playing on Arc",

I&#39;m using the GOG version of Anomaly with no other mods than default and running it through WINE. AFAIK, at some point when a certain object is on screen the game crashes. This is the error message:</p> <p>Wine C++ Runtime Library (Window Title):</p> <p>Assertion Failed!</p> <p>Program: C:\\GOG Games\\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly\\bin\\AnomalyDX11AVX.exe File: ../wine/dlls/d3d11/inputlayout.c Line: 416</p> <p>Expression: &quot;iface-&gt;lpVtbl==&amp;d3d11_input_layout_vtbl&quot;</p> <p>The wine debugger doesn&#39;t help either. Just says &quot;an unhandled exception occurred.&quot; Using other versions of DirectX or turning off support for AVX doesn&#39;t help either. I&#39;ve turned off or lowered every graphical setting I can and nothing. I thought maybe it&#39;s a shader and using a shader mod (ScreenSpaceShaders) might help but it only just made things worse.</p> <",
