It&#39;s a simple dueler where you have to get either 5 different wizards out or five of the same. Each has a unique ability to try to stop your opponent from doing the same. It has some depth of strategy for how simple this game is.

I love getting chances to pull this one out. </p> <p><strong>Two Towers - Trick Taking Game</strong>. There was a prerelease event in my area so I got a copy of this early. It&#39;s basically the same as Fellowship but instead of a ring suit it has a black tower and a white tower (win the trick, but they cancel each other when played together) along with three orc cards (lose the trick, cannot be lead. Everyone loses if you are forced to lead one.)</p> <p><strong>Ascending Empires</strong>. My friends and I were obsessed with the original, playing the demo copy at our FLGS almost a dozen times. This version lives up to that nostalgia and then makes it better in every way. </p",
