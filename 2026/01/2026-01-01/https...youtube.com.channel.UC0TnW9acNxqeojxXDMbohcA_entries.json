        "description": "This is probably the most comprehensive, no-bullshit breakdown of boundaries you're going to find anywhere. We cover what boundaries actually are (spoiler: it\u2019s not just telling people to f*ck off), why they matter more than you think, and how your entire life\u2014your relationships, mental health, identity, even career\u2014is quietly shaped by whether or not you have them.\n\nBy the end of this, you\u2019ll know exactly how to set boundaries, how to enforce them without being a jerk, and how to stop confusing your preferences, rules, and passive-aggressive texts for actual emotional maturity. Plus, we talk about how the internet has totally mangled this concept and what to do instead. If you\u2019ve ever felt burned out, resentful, overwhelmed, or just vaguely annoyed by everyone around you... this is for you.\n\nWe also put together a free companion guide for this episode with all the takeaways, references, and tools to help you get your sh*t together once and for all.
