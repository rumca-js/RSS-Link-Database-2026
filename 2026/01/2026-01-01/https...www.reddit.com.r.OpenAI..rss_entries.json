I\u2019ll keep the story short.</p> <p>One of my API keys was abused by a frustrated ex-developer of my company. Luckily, I was able to see in a short period of time that the credits of my account had been funded twice in less than 24h (normally, it is +/- once per month). I quickly stopped the bleeding. 108 millions tokens.</p> <p>I then tried to find how to limit this risk.</p> <p>It is not possible. I am on tier 5. OpenAi allows me 200 000$ per month of usage. Which I never plan to go that far, at least not before a few more years and a big business shift.</p> <p>(our costs are around 200$ per month).</p> <p>It is only possible to have notifications, to set a budget, but not a hard limit. At least, not for personal and business accounts. It is only possible for Edu and Enterprise accounts.</p> <p>I cannot explain why, if the possibility to do it exists, why not give it to all accounts? The only reason ",
