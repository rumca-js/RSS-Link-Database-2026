They hold a bit of everything, from videos to photos to music, for about 40 TB of space. It&#39;s just a pain having to plug and unplug each individual hard drive. I know the best solution would be a NAS that has the space to manage everything and transfer all the files there. But I don&#39;t want to leave the HDDs abandoned in a drawer. Is there something I can do to connect them all and then plug them into a USB port on my QNAP NAS (which I only use for personal backups) so I can access the files remotely? How much would it cost?

I am looking to buy about ~100 TB of effective storage in either raid z1 or z2 which means 5 or so 24ish TB drives in raid z1 or 8 to 9 14ish TB drives in raid z2. </p> <p>I am leaning towards buying the larger size drives with recertified enterprise drives, even if the storage cost is around $15/TB. My main concern is that the drives will function quickly, efficiently, be fairly reliable, and I can warranty them if I have issues with them. I use my drives for a jellyfin streaming server that serves about 5 people max at any one time. </p> <p>Serverpartdeals seems to fill these requirements, but you end up having to pay $15/TB or more if you want really nice drives and they are all second hand. I am not opposed to shucking, but I am concerned with the varying quality of the drives t",
