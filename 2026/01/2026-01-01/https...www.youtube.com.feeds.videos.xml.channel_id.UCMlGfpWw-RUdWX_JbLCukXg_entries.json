Packs were originally designed for perfect forwarding, not compile-time iteration, which makes even simple tasks like filtering or transformation awkward. std::integer_sequence helps, but mostly by shifting the burden rather than removing it. \n \nExisting library utilities offer some relief, but often feel inconsistent and difficult to compose. This talk explores why working with packs and tuples feels harder than it should, and demonstrates a small set of clean, reusable abstractions that make these tasks simpler, safer, and more expressive. Attendees will leave with practical tools\u2014(and, with luck, a renewed hope) that structured metaprogramming in",

This talk examines some API techniques -- mechanical and structural -- that I've introduced to production libraries, based on reviewing code where folks were trying to achieve their goals, but with suboptimal formulations. C++ was able to do better, albeit sometimes in non-obvious ways. \n \nWe'll look at real code: dealing with the complexities of common cross-cutting concerns like IO, concurrency, logging, handling time, or dealing with hardware quirks. API patterns that enable our teams to write code that really achieves zero-cost abstraction at the scale of subsystems. Moving code reviews beyond the \"\"easy mode\"\" recommendations of using algorithms over raw loops, to cultivating a sensibility for code that is more declarative, correct by construction, high performing, and obvious in intent. \n \nMore tools in the toolbox means",
