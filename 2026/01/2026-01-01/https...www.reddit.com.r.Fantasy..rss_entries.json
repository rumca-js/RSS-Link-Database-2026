Rated an <strong>8</strong>. My choice for SPFBO #10 winner. Ended up being the winner as well. Well written and intriguing read.<br/> 3. <strong>Raised By a Serial Killer by April Balascio</strong>. Read by Author. Non-fiction so no rating, as I do not rate non-fiction currently. I have not read a lot of non-fiction in of this type (Serial killer /crime).

I am fairly certain the title has something to do with roses. What I remember from the little bit I read was that it was a set in a pretty dark fantasy world, and in this world there was a large forest, but anyone who went in the forest never came out. Except the main character was the only person who had ever gone in and returned - she had done so in her childhood I believe but it was very traumatic. I only read the first chapter, but in that chapter the protagonist was taken from her home by the king&#39;s men, pretty sure she was a peasant under a tyrant king. Th",

Seeing different reviews, saying it was a flop and another review saying it was the best book they read of 2025, I suppose I tempered my expectations going into it. I did a mix of reading the book and audiobook so Pacey\u2018s performance always delight\u2019s and brings the quality up. I can agree, it lacked the depth that some of his other books had in character work and plot, but it seems Joe likes to switch styles a bit in his books so we got a junk food esk nitty-gritty fast paced action one. I think it still held a lot of what people like about Joe\u2019s writing, humor, interesting characters, moral ambiguity, realistic bitter endings, and some nicely delivered lines of commentary on human behavior, and in this case religion. </p> <p>I hope in the coming books we get more of Balthazar, I would love to see him take down the corrupt church and break the bind",
