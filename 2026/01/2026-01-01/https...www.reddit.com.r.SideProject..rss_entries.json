There were no viral moments or sudden wins. Revenue lagged effort more than I would have liked.</p> <p>But it mattered.</p> <p>This was the first year I treated personal projects as a serious practice instead of side experiments. I spent a lot of time exploring, learning, and building, especially around AI capabilities and what actually works versus what just sounds promising.</p> <p>Some things shipped. Some stayed experimental. All of it helped clarify where real leverage is and where optionality starts to slow progress.</p> <p>The biggest takeaway for me was focus. Small, finished things compound better than ambitious half-built ones. Shipping creates feedback. Feedback creates clarity.</p> <p>I wrote a longer reflection on what I built in 2025 and what I\u2019m carrying into 2026 here, in case it\u2019s useful to others navigating something similar",

Creating the right prompts for each client\u2019s request was tricky and slow. I found myself spending too much time crafting prompts for ChatGPT to generate the perfect AI-ready instructions.
