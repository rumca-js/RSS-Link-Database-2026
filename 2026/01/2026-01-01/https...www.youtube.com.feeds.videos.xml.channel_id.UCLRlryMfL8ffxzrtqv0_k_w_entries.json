Two 'PONIES' ('persons of no interest' in intelligence speak) work anonymously as secretaries in the American Embassy. That is until their husbands are killed under mysterious circumstances in the USSR, and the pair become CIA operatives. Bea is an over-educated, Russian-speaking child of Soviet immigrants. Her cohort, Twila, is a small-town girl who is as abrasive as she is fearless. Together, they work to uncover a vast Cold War conspiracy and solve the mystery that made them widows in the first place.\n\nPONIES (2026) is the new drama series starring Emilia Clarke, Haley Lu Richardson and Adrian Lester.\n\nNote | #Ponies #Trailer courtesy of Universal Pictures. | All Rights Reserved. #KinoCheck\u00ae",
