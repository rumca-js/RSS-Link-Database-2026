Now i understand we need to build a custom web-scraper then which can scrape this js rendered content (for which i am leaning towards playwright) but the issue is that i am not sure how i would provide the url from which the content is being scraped to the kb so that when my agent uses it , it can give me reference links for all citations Bedrock crawlers can do this by default but i am unsure how custom web scrapped data , stored in s3 can contain the source url which will go in kb and bedrock model will use at the time of answering </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
