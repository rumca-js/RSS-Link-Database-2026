The files all seem to be encrypted. I changed the extension and opened them and data was all gibberish. There is a ransom note in each folder. One of the backup PC&#39;s was completely affected and all it&#39;s files were altered, while on another PC only some of the backups were affected while some were not.

Specifically, can it jump from a computer to a usb to another computer and execute on that second computer without running anything? I am seeing mixed responses online because some say that after autoruns was replaced by autoplay, viruses were no longer able to spread from a usb to a computer. Others say that usb viruses are still extremely common and that they are just able to exploit and bypass the autoplay system and run automatically. All responses are greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SilverDonut3992\"> /u/SilverDonut3992 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1q129qx/usb_malware/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1q129qx/usb_malware/\">[comments]</a></span>",
