But if the &quot;anonymity set&quot; (the number of people in the pool) is small, you&#39;re still traceable via timing or volume. I found a project called An\u2064oma building something called MASP (Multi-Asset Shielded Pool). It lets different assets share the <em>same</em> pool. This seems like the only way to get a big enough crowd to actually hide in.
