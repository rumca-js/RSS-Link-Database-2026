Where does all of that usually live for you - Google Docs, Word, Notion, something else, or a mix?</p> <p>I\u2019m also interested in how AI fits into this now. Are you using it for outlines, drafts, rewrites, content refreshes, or research? And does it integrate cleanly into your writing flow, or feel like a separate step you jump in and out of?</p> <p>What tends to break first as things scale or get messy - keeping content in sync with what\u2019s live, losing context when revisiting old posts, versioning, collaboration, or something else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chucki_e\"> /u/Chucki_e </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1q4e5dg/how_does_writing_actually_fit",

So how can you tell?</p> <p>BTW, just for laughs, in marketing I always get CVs of pretty girls who claim to be marketing specialists or social media experts, because their bikini photos got them 10k followers on IG.</p> <p>",
