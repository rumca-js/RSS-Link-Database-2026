Prevailing optimism is often grounded in computational functionalism: the assumption that consciousness is determined solely by the right pattern of information processing, independent of the physical substrate. Opposing this, biological naturalism insists that conscious experience is fundamentally dependent on the concrete physical processes of living systems. Despite the centrality of these positions to the artificial consciousness debate, there is currently no coherent framework that explains how biological computation differs from digital computation, and why this difference might matter for consci",

Rather than treating organisms, genes, or fitness as primary explanatory units, ICT identifies information capable of generational continuity as the fundamental entity of life. Evolution is reframed as the historical outcome of differential informational persistence under environmental constraints. The theory is substrate-independent and applies to biological, cultural, and artificial systems.

After almost 17 months of my unresolved medical problems, I finally went to AI as an option. </p> <p>With mixed feelings, the medical advice was amazing - very clear and concise, and it was a wave of relief for myself, but I feel awful now for using AI.

There is a lot of talk right now about learning AI. New courses, new models, and several new prompt techniques. It feels like many people are stuck in a loop of constantly trying to keep up. Agree that learning is important, but at the same time, a much smaller group of teams is doing something very different. Instead of spending all their time talking about models, they are building systems that run. I feel things like: pulling data from a database,sending it into an LLM, pushing the result back into a real working AI system, and letting it do actual work.

The goal is simple: help me (and anyone interested) get slightly better every day without turning life into a KPI grind.</p> <p>What\u2019s new / why now: Frontier models (e.g., GPT\u20115.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5) are increasingly agentic: they can plan, call tools, handle long contexts, and work through multi-step tasks. And with Model Context Protocol (MCP), you can plug an AI into real tools (calendar, notes, tasks, files, messaging, etc.) in a standardized way.</p> <p>Core idea: Most people don\u2019t fail because they don\u2019t \u201cknow what to do\u201d. They fail because friction is high: scheduling, setup, decision fatigue, context switching, messy tool stacks. So the Life OS is not just a coach it\u2019s an operator.</p> <p>What it would feel like: 1) Monthly \u201cLife Compass\u201d (values + boundaries) - Define what matters, and what must never be sacrificed (s",
