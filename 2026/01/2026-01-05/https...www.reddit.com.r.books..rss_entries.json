Think about when Klara was sharing her musings about where the thing that makes someone so special and loved resides - she determines that thing is not inside a person (Josie) herself but inside the people who love her. When I read this, it made me think about the idea that &quot;love is selfish&quot;. Actually it reminded me of one of my favorite lyrics that says &quot;I&#39;ve read the books, I know that love&#39;s a selfish thing.&quot; But is it? Or if it&#39;s selfish, is it actually love?</p> <p>So Klara determines that love is people&#39;s reaction to a person - it&#39;s almost a thing they impose upon a person, with or without the",

I&#39;ve obviously read them and analysed them in depth and have enjoyed it, even if a lot of the books weren&#39;t my style.</p> <p>My problem is that beyond that, I have not read anything else because I am simply too tired, and I hate it. I made it through 3 non-school books last school year and so far 0 for this year. As ridiculous as it sounds, I feel like I&#39;m burnt out from my 11.5 books a year and can&#39;t find the motivation to read just for fun anymore.</p> <p>Between the unmedicated ADHD, newfound disabilities, and never-ending pile of essays I have to write, it&#39;s been hard for me to sustain most hobbies, but especially one like reading which actually requir",

My review is below, with a warning before the spoilers </p> <p>This book was hard to put down, for different reasons depending on what part of the book I was reading. The protagonist is very troubled, in ways I&#39;ve never experienced in other books, which was interesting and added to the inability to set this book aside. Part obsessive and passionate love story, and partly a mad man&#39;s diary, this book is unlike any I&#39;ve read before. If you choose to read it, be aware of the triggers if that is something that concerns you</p> <p><strong><em>Spoilers Ahead</em></strong></p> <p>To say the least, Jacob is a troubled and oftentimes unreliable narrator plagued by obsessive thoughts, rage, and paranoia. He also is inordinately concerned with his personal hygiene and fails to socialize well, leading him to read somewhat autisti",

The first, is that &quot;cozy&quot; really doesn&#39;t mean anything; there&#39;s nothing aesthetic or substantive that brings out that feeling and it seems more so to indicate that the reader found some unique personal comfort in the media rather than it being a description of any textual element. The second call, and the one that&#39;s significantly more frustrating in my opinion, is where the &quot;cozy&quot; elements are purely window dressing but otherwise irrelevant to the plot. The plot is a path, and these elements line the path, aesthetically present but ultimately irrelevant to the plot. I could name at l",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This book was on the Hot Picks shelf at my local library and I decided to give it a try. I love mysteries - huge Agatha Christie fan - both Poirot and Marple! But also read contemporary - ann cleeves, Louise penny, and some that veer into the comedy spectrum like Anthony horowitz, Richard osman, and that Vera Wong series. So I was a bit weary of this one because it had a such a kitschy title and the cover art (I know, I know) looked so gimmicky. With the explosion of Richard osman&#39;s success, there seem to be quite a few copycat formulaic series complete with the same style of cover art. </p> <p>It really exceeded my expectations. Great writing, a modern vision of South Asian immigrant communities. This book is set in Scarborough Ontario and so vividly described. But what I also loved about it is that the protagonist is an Indian woman in her 50s whose traditional life was upended by the sudden death of a child and later death of her husband. Many ",
