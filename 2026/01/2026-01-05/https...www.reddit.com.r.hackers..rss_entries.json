Now I am 16 y.o. and I am in the final year of my school, now I devote all my time to four subjects that I take on the exam (called NMT). I will enter Lviv in Ukraine (Lviv Polytechnic or Lviv Ivan Franko University) to the specialty of cybersecurity. I know almost nothing about hacking... at school they don&#39;t really teach computer science, and at home I&#39;m trying to learn Python somehow. I wanted to ask your opinion: if I start learning something this summer, I&#39;ll have to get into it, at least some kind of base before the university, and when I enter the university itself (I hope they won&#39;t treat these subjects like our teachers at school now), is there a chance that I will be successful in this field and that I will understand it? Are there any tips? I will be glad to hear every opinion</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sweet_corgii\"> /u/sweet_co",
