        "description": "You've heard that too much time online is bad for your mental health, but what is it doing to your body? In this energizing talk, journalist and author Manoush Zomorodi explains how tech habits (including sitting all day) affect your physical health, from making you feel exhausted to raising rates of chronic illness. With early results from a 20,000-person experiment, she shares a practical solution to go from \"wired and tired\" to feeling healthier and more productive.
