More importantly, I have extensive experience using AI as a tool (and not a substitute).</p> <p>That said, while working on a few Agile projects, I noticed that we can actually do things differently (whether it\u2019s better or worse remains to be seen, but the results so far are encouraging).</p> <p><strong>Introducing LINA:</strong> A hybrid methodology that successfully implements a &quot;human-in-the-loop&quot; approach with AI. If followed correctly, it allows you to almost entirely eliminate overall technical debt and speed up development by <strong>AT LEAST 33%</strong>.</p> <p>I\u2019ll leave the link to the GitHub Re",
