        "description": "On this episode of the Awards Tour podcast, Rotten Tomatoes Awards Editor Jacqueline Coley sits down with Emmy-nominated actor, writer, and producer Will Arnett to talk about his latest film, \u2018Is This Thing On?\u2019\n\nIn the film, Arnett stars as Alex Novak, a devoted family man navigating divorce who unexpectedly finds therapy through stand-up comedy. In their conversation, Arnett opens up about being directed by Bradley Cooper, how intimidating it was to perform stand-up for the role, and emotionally preparing for the film\u2019s most vulnerable moments alongside Laura Dern.\n\nThis episode also looks back on Arnett\u2019s iconic career, from voicing the endlessly quotable \u2018BoJack Horseman,\u2019 to chasing Will Ferrell on the ice in \u2018Blades of Glory,\u2019 to a surreal Oscars memory involving Marion Cotillard while dressed in a Batman costume.\n\nCheck out \u2018Is This Thing On?\u2019 in theaters now, and we\u2019ll see you on the next stop on the awards tour.\n\n\u25ba Learn more: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/is_this_thing_on",
