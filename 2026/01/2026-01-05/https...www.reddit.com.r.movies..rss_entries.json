Let&#39;s start by saying that I&#39;m a Talking Heads fan, so I knew many of the songs and even something about their stage mannerisms. And yet, it left me speechless.</p> <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had so much fun and felt so involved watching a film. Byrne and the rest of the band not only manage to bring all their songs to life perfectly, but they do something even more difficult: they make them believable. The cinematography is simple, precise, and tries to make room for all the characters, while the audience is revealed only in the final moments. The set design changes as the songs progress, and the frontman&#39;s movements reflect the mood of the song. The song list is also wonderful, each one better than the last.</p> <p>So, what do you think of Stop Making Sense?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mattone_Martello\"> /u/Mattone_Martello </a> ",

Once later films provide clearer resolutions, more backstory and direction, the emotional weight of that first story shifts in a way that makes it feel less complete on its own.</p> <p>Are there other films you feel were better served by ambiguity rather than explanation or continuation?

And let&#39;s just say he did that very well. I tried to look at his filmography and I don&#39;t think there are many films where he tries to do something different. Maybe &quot;The Wild Geese,&quot; but I last saw it like 30 years ago.</p> <p>So I ask, what&#39;s the general opinion about this actor? That he could only do one thing and did it very well? Or are there gems in his filmography where he was able to showcase his talent?</p> <p>Oh, I saw he was also in Curse of the Pink Panther. I remember his cameo.

And for the first half, that\u2019s exactly what it is. It plays like a standard 2000s Sandler vehicle. There&#39;s broad humor, a silly sci-fi premise, and the fantasy of skipping the annoying parts of life.</p> <p>But somewhere around the midpoint, the movie quietly pulls the rug and what starts as a series of jokes about laziness and convenience turns into something tragic.
