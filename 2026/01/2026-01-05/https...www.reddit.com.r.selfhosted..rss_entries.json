Can punch through heavy firewalls (Corporate/DPI) by looking like regular web browsing (SNI Masquerading). Is easy to self-host with a single binary or Docker container.</p> <p>Features: Automatic Mesh: Nodes find each other via gossip; no manual routing tables.</p> <p>Self-Healing: If a direct link dies, it automatically re-routes packets through neighbors.</p> <p>One-Click Docker: Includes a docker-compose to spin up a test lab instantly. It&#39;s fully open source (MIT).

Closed source tools are harder to trust, especially for sensitive data, since we can\u2019t verify what is happening behind the scenes.</p> <p>The solution: I think we can still allow closed source tools, but with more vetting.

That way, the community can get a better sense of how the tool works and whether it is safe and worth sharing.</p> <p>Why this helps the group: This approach respects the diverse interests in this subreddit.
