I&#39;ve been using an HMDI-AV converter to connect to my CRT, which has worked in the past with laptops/pcs. I booted the rasp pi with batocera os, and was greeted with an inability to partition as FAT, and upon checking the sd was formatted in FAT32, so i summed it up to a faulty sd. However, upon trying with another sd, no signal was able to be recieved, though the OS had been downloaded to the new sd, and the set up remained the same. I&#39;ve tied reinstalling the os various times, and swapped between HDMI cables and power supplies. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Pea6347\"> /u/Longjumping-Pea6347 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1q4aofc/rasp_pi_to_crt_signal_errors/",
