Mihoyo games are straight up the only hurdle I have, as it&#39;s not officially supported on Linux. I know it can be supported via Wine. Mihoyo&#39;s anti-cheat software isn&#39;t compatible with this, and so, it carries the risk of a ban.</p> <p>Just wanted a 2026 update if there are any real cases of players who weren&#39;t tampering with the game&#39;s mechanics, that got banned for playing Genshin on Linux. I&#39;d really hate to resort to mobile only or a dual boot for a single game.

I enable Enable WINE Wayland, which at least removed the crash report of the launcher crashing (even though the game started). No avail.</p> <p>Within the game I tried exclusive Window mode and borderless mode, enable driver fix (found that one on ProtonDB) and still, after some turns the game gets unresponsive for some",

I recently decided to try using steam natively as the launcher for my games, since I heard that it&#39;s pretty good now. Until then I was just launching the exe files via Faugus launcher. I installed the required Proton packages and set everything up as needed (enabling proton, choosing the version and for a good meassure even forcing proton) and tried launching my game, which I know my laptop can play, but nothing happened. It just started, displayed nothing and then shut down. I tried several different Proton versions, but nothing helped. I&#39;ll be grateful for any advice on how to resolve this. Oh and also, I&#39;m using Fedora linux.

I have heard that razer had some features turned on by default that I would maybe like to turn off like asymmetric cuf-off and motion sync, so can you change those type of settings on linux?

I mean, I can install wine, lutris, and nvidia drivers according to my distros wiki and it runs fine but not 100% error-free for all my games. Could anyone explain to me that this gaming-oriented distro might be better than a more &quot;mainstream&quot; distro?

Currently in the low preset I&#39;m getting between 30-40, when on Windows I got double the framerate. I know it might be a little whining from me, but playing an FPS on that framerate is not very optimal. My specs:</p> <p>AMD Ryzen 5 5500</p> <p>AMD RADEON RX 6600</p> <p>24GB DDR4 3200MT</p> <p>500W PSU</p> <p>NVME 500GB (game is installed in there)</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried some commands that I&#39;ve seen on ProtonDB, like gamemoderun and trying to change vulkan versions, but I somehow can&#39;t install AMDVLK no matter what.</p> <p>Also, framegen is also broken.
