The Time Machine is just an external 8TB drive that I plug in every few days.</p> <p>I\u2019d like the Plex NAS to backup automatically whenever new files are added. I\u2019d like the Time Machine backup to also automatically backup. The rest of the files are static.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an option, but is it possible to set it up so that if a drive fails there\u2019s a secondary copy of the data stored on it in the backup device?</p> <",

I don&#39;t consider myself a hoarder as I have a small collection (under 2TB) but I LOVE music so i dabble in audiophile subreddits. Mp3&#39;s and WAV&#39;s are the major contributor to my collection. I&#39;m already aware of some awesome software already (mp3diags, Mediainfo, MP3tag and of course windows media player) but what else can I use to refine my collection? Expand my downloading ability?

The shells give the drive a bit more shipping durability and make it easy for the buyer to validate the disk.
