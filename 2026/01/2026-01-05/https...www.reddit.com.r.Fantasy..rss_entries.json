        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey!<br/> I was never much of reading fantasy books despite having an extremely basic and rudimentary notion about authors and stories in general. I&#39;m very used to reading great Chinese fantasy novels (Wuxia, Xianxia, etc).That said, I only read The Hobbit a long time ago, when I didn&#39;t understand anything about Tolkien&#39;s works (I can&#39;t say I know anything now). So, considering my little baggage in the British and American fantasy genre, I would like suggestions for books so that I can start. I would like something beyond the generic Tolkien type. I&#39;m wanting to read something closer to a dark fantasy, probably similar to Elric of Melnibon\u00e9(I&#39;ve only heard this book is less witty/high spirits)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Big-Let-3113\"> /u/Big-Let-3113 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1q50ysm/help_with_the_start/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",

I finished Assassin&#39;s Apprentice early last year and enjoyed it quite a bit though it did make me cry. </p> <p>I have been trying to get into Royal Assassin for months and months now, and I just feel stuck. It feels hopeless and bleak and like everything is going wrong for no real payoff or reason. I have seen tons of people online saying it just gets more depressing. My question is, is there a reason? I can handle horrible things happening to characters, I can handle darkness and suffering in my books, but I need there to be some sort of payoff or message or purpose behind it all I suppose. I need to know the author isn&#39;t just hurting the characters for shock or to be depressing to no end. For in",

My brother jokes that I find the series, and he finishes them. It&#39;s not that I typically lose interest - otherwise they&#39;d be on the DNF list and not the TBR! I think I just like finding new stories and recommendations, or read something that speaks to my vibe in the moment, with the anticipation of wandering back at some point. And to be honest - knowing that there&#39;s a book waiting for me in a beloved series is warming and nostalgic in a way. I do continue to make progress on them (9 of last year&#39;s books were towards completion of a series) - and mostly I have little problems diving back in. </p> <p>However - it&#39;s starting to stretch too far for easily diving back in! A couple of series have gotten to the point where I wanted to reread from the first novel to have a fresh start and freshen my memo",
