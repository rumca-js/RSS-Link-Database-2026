Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.\n\nOn today's show, acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez invited the US to work with the country in a \"balanced and respectful\" relationship. Donald Trump said Washington would cooperate but needs \u201ctotal access\u201d to the South American country, saying \u201cwe\u2019re in charge.\u201d\n\nUS Secretary Marco Rubio says the US will use oil leverage to press for further change in Venezuela as he seeks to reshape Latin America in Washington\u2019s favor.\n\nOil fluctuated as traders weighed the impact of the US raid on global supply. Gold and silver surged. Asian shares rose to a record.\n\nToday's guests: Council on Foreign Relations Fellow Roxanna Vigil. (Source: Bloomberg)",
