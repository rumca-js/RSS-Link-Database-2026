        "description": "Code Vein 2 Gameplay Impressions - Is It BETTER Than the FIRST GAME??\nIn this video, I'm going to be talking about my hands on impressions with Code Vein 2. I was graciously invited to Lyon, France, the headquarters of Bandai Namco Europe in December. Got to play about 2-3 hours or so while I was there. So I want to talk a bit about what I like about the game, what I don't like about it, and also what similarities and difference it has to the first title.\n\nCode Vein 2 Wiki: https://codevein2.wiki.fextralife.com/Code+Vein+2+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Code Vein 2 Gameplay Impressions\n0:24 What is Code Vein\n1:57 Code Vein 2 Art Style\n2:55 Open World\n4:05 Blood Codes\n5:41 Companion\n6:55 UI/UX\n7:30 Character Creation\n8:00 Combat\n9:18 Story Telling\n10:05 Anime, Motorcycle, and Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https",
