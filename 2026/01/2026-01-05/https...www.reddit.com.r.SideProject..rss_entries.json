Often, the problem statement itself is unclear at the beginning of a process, and part of that process may involve figuring out what needs to be built, even before writing any code.</p> <p>If you\u2019re working on something like this, maybe a new product, perhaps a system ",

Now that I&#39;m learning German, I searched for something similar, but couldn&#39;t find anything, so I decided to build it myself.</p> <p>In the process, I realized how incredibly scattered and unstructured learning resources are for any subject. The same frustration applies to finding a clear path to follow without getting lost in the chaos of resources.</p> <p>So \u00dcben aims to solve that. I&#39;ve created a resources page where people can submit and discover materials filtered by language and their types, so anyone looking for the right resources can find them all in one place. Users can also explore roadmaps to guide their learning journey for any language or subject, which really makes a difference.</p> <p>You can even import decks from Anki , ma",

The goal is simple: help me (and anyone interested) get slightly better every day without turning life into a KPI grind.</p> <p>What\u2019s new / why now: Frontier models (e.g., GPT\u20115.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5) are increasingly agentic: they can plan, call tools, handle long contexts, and work through multi-step tasks. And with Model Context Protocol (MCP), you can plug an AI into real tools (calendar, notes, tasks, files, messaging, etc.) in a standardized way.</p> <p>Core idea: Most people don\u2019t fail because they don\u2019t \u201cknow what to do\u201d. They fail because friction is high: scheduling, setup, decision fatigue, context switching, messy tool stacks. So the Life OS is not just a coach it\u2019s an operator.</p> <p>What it would feel like: 1) Monthly \u201cLife Compass\u201d (values + boundaries) - Define what matters, and what must never be sacrificed (s",

Also as the postings appear there they probably got hundreds applications already.</p> <p>So I created telegram bot @faangapply_bot which gets postings directly from company&#39;s sites, allows to apply filters (including filtering by seniority level) and receive notifications about new eng postings as soon as they appear. It also has info on when the postings appeared so that you know you are applying to a fresh one.</p> <p>Currently it&#39;s tracking only FAANG postings but more to be added in the future. I am also working on the web app version.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BumblebeeAlive1481\"> /u/BumblebeeAlive1481 </a> <br/> <",
