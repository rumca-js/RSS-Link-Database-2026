The flying machine has a machine gun and missiles.

I couldn&#39;t walk into the enemy fire. The machine gun shots always shot the exact same distance from you no matter where you moved. The missiles were also so far ahead of you, and you couldn&#39;t even jump into them. So I just casually walked the rest of the way, moving as slowly as possible. I even walked through the fire graphics on the floor, but nothing happened. &nbsp;</p> <p>This really pissed me off.
