However, one grocery store has recently upped their security or something, and now, whenever the browser is programmatically generated, it automatically blocks the page. I have tried using rotating residential proxies as well, but this doesn&#39;t help. The website is <a href=\"https://giantfood.com\">https://giantfood.com</a>. Has anyone ever encountered this issue? Further, does anyone know how to bypass this issue, other than using the mobile api? I don&#39;t have a burner mobile device readily available to me.</p> <p>A potential solution I thought of was creating an extension that basically drops real cookies into an accessible area for me to use from my real chrome browser since human-like accesses to the webpage are allowed, but this links me with my real world information which I am not keen on",
