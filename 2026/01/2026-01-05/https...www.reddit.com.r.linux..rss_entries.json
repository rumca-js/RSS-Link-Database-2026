When I backup my files to my other drives, I tend to copy an <em>entire folder</em> over instead of trying to pick out each and every individual file one-by-one that is different. There may also be slight differences in file versions between drives, so I wanna make sure I can see this at a glance with the file size. Windows makes this really simple by doing a listed side-by-side comparison of the old file and the new file that you can scroll through. It even highlights where the differences are, and also has the option to skip any file with the same date and size.</p> <p>Edit: I have multiple devices I work from.
