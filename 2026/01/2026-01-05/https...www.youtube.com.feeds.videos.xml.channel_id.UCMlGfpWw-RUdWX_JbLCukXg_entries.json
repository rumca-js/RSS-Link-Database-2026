The use of ranges (along with the pipe syntax) can help you write more elegant and less error-prone code. But how and where to get started? Have no fear, in this talk I will provide a gentle introduction to getting you started with ranges. After attending this talk, you will be able to navigate ranges, know the difference between a range 'adaptor' and a range 'view', and be able to start using ranges in any C++20 compiler. \n\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2025/blob/main/Presentations/Back_To_Basics_Ranges.pdf\n\nWork at Hudson River Trading (HRT): https://tinyurl.com/safxfctf\n---\n\nMike Shah\n \nMike Shah is currently a teaching faculty at Yale University with primary teaching interests  in computer systems, computer graphics, and game engines. Mike's research interests are related to performance eng",
