The model works by breaking down unexpected driving situations into a smaller set of problems before finding the safest  path forward. At each step of the way, the model can explain its reasoning. </p><p>A sister model named AlpaSim allows developers to do closed-loop training for driving scenarios that are rarely encountered in real life.

In a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384\"><ins>post on X</ins></a>, the company says the 8BitDo FlipPad will debut in the summer of 2026 and will be compatible with iOS and Android devices. It also mentions the peripheral is &quot;officially supported by Apple.&quot;</p>\n<p>The post doesn&#39;t give too much away, as the company will be premiering the FlipPad at CES this week. A short, rendered video shows that the mobile gaming peripheral connects via USB-C, and then flips upward on a hinge to lay flat against the bottom portion of a user&#39;s phone screen. In the rendering, we can see a directional pad, purple ABXY buttons, select, start buttons and six more unlabeled buttons.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>8BitDo makes a lot of gaming controllers, including retro-inspired ones like the <a data-i",

JBL Quantum 950X is the latest set of flagship headphones from the brand, with 50mm carbon dynamic drivers and features such as spatial audio, 3D head tracking and active noise cancelation. The set is compatible with PC, consoles and mobile platforms through 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 5.3 or wired connection. The 950X has a pair of hot-swappable and rechargeable batteries that give 50 hours of playtime. It comes with a 6mm cardioid boom microphone that uses AI noise reduction to keep background sounds out of in-game communication. The headset will retail for $400 and will be available starting in April 2026.</p><p>The other two new products are the JBL Quantum 650X and the JBL Quantum 250.

But unlike other versions, this one requires no subscription, lets you swap out the surrounding frame and doesn\u2019t require an app to upload the art. Instead, a built-in mic picks up your idea, sends it to OpenAI and creates an image that pops up in a few moments on the screen. The on-board accelerometer even knows whether the device is in landscape or portrait orientation, and applies the correct format.</p>\n<p>A purchase of the Fraimic comes with 100 free AI creations per year, and if that\u2019s not enough, you can buy more. But if, like me, you don\u2019t consider the images a machine\u2019s brain smashes together to actually be art, the Fraimic also allows you to upload your own images via the brand\u2019s website. And should that website ever go away, your device isn\u2019t obsolete, as it can also handle local uploads. </p>\n<figure>\n <img src",

PartyKeys and PartyStudio are a 36-key MIDI keyboard and MIDI / Bluetooth speaker that pair together in seamless fashion. The PartyStudio is particularly interesting because it has a built-in library of 128 instrument tones and more than 50 different drum machine patterns. Naturally, it works with the PartyKeys, but any MIDI keyboard can connect to it and use those sounds. </p><p>The PartyStudio and PartyKeys both use NFC to connect to each other \u2014 you can just tap and hold the keyboard up to the speaker for pairing. You can connect up to three devices using MIDI over Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE MIDI) as well as a fourth using a wired connection.

It charges wirelessly via an optical infrared beam with a four-meter range.  A small device, connected to a standard outlet inside the house, shoots a beam at the lock, which has a small receptor panel that turns the light into power, sort of like a plug-in sun beaming at a tiny solar array.  The tech carries certifications from two independent organizations, and won\u2019t harm eyeballs or bodies that get in the way of the beam (though if the beam is interrupted, charging stops). </p><p>The lock itself is a mortise lock that will likely require a pro to install, as it\u2019s not just a standard deadbolt replacer. It\u2019s not a standard lock in other ways too, with video and speaker capabilites, AI recognition as well as touchscreen features and vein recognition. </p><p>The tall black rectangle looked sleek (if huge) in person with a pocket-style gr",
