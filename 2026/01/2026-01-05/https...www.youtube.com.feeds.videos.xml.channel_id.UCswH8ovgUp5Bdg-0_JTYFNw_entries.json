        "description": "Russell responds to Eddie Gallagher asking whether anyone in the UK is fighting back, arguing that resistance exists but stays fractured by years of cultural division, economic hollowing-out, and identity-driven politics. He traces the turning point from post-2008 populist anger and Occupy into a media landscape that shattered the old gatekeepers\u2014then makes the case that politics is next, pushing toward localized sovereignty and decentralised decision-making as the only way out of permanent culture war.\n[STREAMED]\n\nGo to https://rumble.com/premium/BRAND and join the movement.\n\nENTER THE REBORN GIVEAWAY \u2014 I\u2019m giving away a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 plus $10,000 cash through my new brand, Reborn.
