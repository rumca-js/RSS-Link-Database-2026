Anyway, I ended up deleting them shortly after. It has now been 10 years after I\u2019ve deleted them and I was wondering if there\u2019s anyway possible way to recover them? I don\u2019t have any URLs or titles of videos which makes it hard, but I still have access to the YouTube account that I uploaded them on. </p> <p>I was speaking to a friend who worked in the tech departments a while ago and he seemed to believe I\u2019ll be able to retrieve them one way or another because \u2018whatever makes it on the Internet, stays on the internet\u2019 supposedly.</p> <p>I\u2019m not particularly stressed, it would just be funny to go back and watch the shenanigans I used to do when I was a kid.</p> <p>Any advice?
