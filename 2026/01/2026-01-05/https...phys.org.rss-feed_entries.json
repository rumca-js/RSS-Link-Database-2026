This rapid optimization process could help manufacture advanced optical systems like camera lenses, virtual reality headsets, holographic imagers and more, the team said.",

According to a new paper by Thomas Winterhalder of the European Southern Observatory and his co-authors, which is available on the arXiv preprint server, the reason isn't because those moons don't exist, but simply because we lack the technology to detect them. They propose a new \"kilometric baseline interferometer\" that can detect moons as small as Earth up to 200 parsecs (652 light years) away.",

Finding a suitable site can be a challenge, and that has been particularly true for the effort to build a 30-meter telescope in the Northern Hemisphere.",

We've generally thought that other main sequence stars behave in much the same way, but when it comes to solar flares, that isn't always true.",
