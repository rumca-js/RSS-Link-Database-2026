        "description": "Walter Hunt is a man who is simultaneously considered to have possessed one of the finest inventive minds in all of American history while also being an individual almost no one has ever heard. This is despite the fact that it's almost guaranteed that one of his inventions is currently lying somewhere in your home, the safety pin. This was something he sold the patent for for a few hundred dollars, reportedly as he needed the money to pay off a $15 debt. This was a theme throughout his life- inventing various items that otherwise should have made him extremely wealthy and famous, but which never did because of his proclivity to sell his patents immediately and move on to his next great invention.\n\nBecause we\u2019d be here all day if we discussed in any level of detail everything Hunt patented during his lifetime, instead we'll give you a small smattering of examples so you can get an idea of how prolific an inventor he was. Along with the safety pin and the first commercially viable locks",
