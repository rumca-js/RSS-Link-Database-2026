Our teachers are not Tech expert so it took them few minutes to stop this shit i continued this in next 2 classes. Later. When offline Classes were continued i walking in class as normal but didn&#39;t realised teachers still remembering that incident. She was looking as she is about to cry seeing that made me feel shamefully and sad too. Later when everyone settled she talked about this incident for an hour. I kept my expressions netural to not get caught. Our university is mostly famous for Cybersecurity courses so I also feared if they tracked me. But I did it will full safety incognito mode on Tor browser with Vpn also I was not logged in. Seeing adults teachers ",
