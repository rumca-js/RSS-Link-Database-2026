On paper, it should eclipse the original, yet it doesn\u2019t seem to get anywhere near the same level of reverence or enthusiasm.

That&#39;s way too long for my group, and from experience, games that say \u201c2 hours\u201d on the box often go longer.</p> <p>Ideally I&#39;m looking for a wargame something that plays in <strong>around 90 minutes</strong>. Scale is something <strong>larger than skirmish scale,</strong> commanding armies or factions rather than individual characters. My friends are more into video games than board games, so anything super long or heavy is a hard sell. <strong>120 minutes</strong> is fine, but that should be the max even during an actual playthrough.</p> <p>I&#39;d prefer historical theme but fantasy is fine too, and I&#39;d prefer games that are not too complex or overwhelming, while still being hard to master.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InterviewEm",

I originally got this as a ten year old kid in 1980. It was the introduction to dungeons and dragons. 45 years later, they heard me talking with my wife about toys we had as kids and hunted down a copy. It\u2019s after 11pm and I have to work in the morning but am still too happy to fall asleep, so I thought I\u2019d share a fun old game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cazzodrago\"> /u/cazzodrago </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4d1kw\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1q4d1kw/pure_nostalgia/\">[com",

I understand that quality/make of the pieces is probably most suitable for this style game but it was extremely annoying that pieces did not want to stay together.</p> <p>Anyway, we built the main puzzle and were super excited to start, loved the app to go with the puzzle and we got to solve some things, opened maybe 4-5 boxes. And I\u2019m frustrated with some puzzles because it seems so illogical(?). I\u2019m tempted to stop and out it away because I\u2019m not enjoying it. I love magic puzzle company puzzles and various board games like Unlock and Exit.
