I am hoping that is subject to change in 2026. I\u2019ve done some research, multiple Reddit threads, multiple videos, articles, etc. Kingsbridge series by Ken Follett specifically The Pillars of the Earth seems to be loved by many. It arrived today finally. Do you believe this is a good starter book to get into reading? I am not too i imitated by its size, being 900+ pages. I\u2019m a bit excited to read it. I guess I\u2019m just hoping I\u2019m not starting at the peak, and the rest of the books i read just won\u2019t interest me near as much.
