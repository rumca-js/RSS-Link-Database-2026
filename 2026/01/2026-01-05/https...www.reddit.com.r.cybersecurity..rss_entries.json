I have been part of several 24/7 teams, some with more clients and others with fewer, and it seems that this has always been a difficult topic to resolve or refine 100%.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried a shared OneNote with several tabs for different clients where the team would put shift information, incidents, threat hunting, IOCs for the next team coming on shift... it didn&#39;t really work, too much info to read.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried a TLP (traffic light protocol) format where you put in ongoing info, incidents happening, and there was a part where you put in what had been done and what was still to be resolved, by criticality green yellow red..",
