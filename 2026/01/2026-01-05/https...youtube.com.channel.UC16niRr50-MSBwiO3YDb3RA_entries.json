Products launched in Seoul are on TikTok and Instagram feeds in the US, UK, India and Australia instantly.\n\nThere are however growing concerns about the social impact of beauty ideals, particularly on young people. Experts warn that constant exposure to skincare content online can fuel anxiety and excessive spending.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#KBeauty #MakeUp #Skincare #BBCNews",
