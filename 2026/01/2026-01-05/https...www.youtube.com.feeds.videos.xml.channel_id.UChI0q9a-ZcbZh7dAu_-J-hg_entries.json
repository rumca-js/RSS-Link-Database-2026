        "description": "After a devastating Hack of Rainbow Six Siege, Ubisoft has been sent reeling as they deal with the aftermath of a multigroup hacking fiasco that left their flagship product crippled. \n\nTrillions in hacked credits were dispersed, with developer skins, ban sprees, and a host of other issues that didnt even settle down into the new year, in fact may actually be getting worse. \n\nWhether or not it was the primary culprit, the new MongoBleed exploit was a lightning rod for attackers all across the internet. \n\n\n\nVX-UNDERGROUND - https://x.com/vxunderground\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@UpperEchelonGamers:3\n\n\n\n\n\u2981 UPPER ECHELON WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg\n\n\n\n \u2981 DISCORD SERVER",
