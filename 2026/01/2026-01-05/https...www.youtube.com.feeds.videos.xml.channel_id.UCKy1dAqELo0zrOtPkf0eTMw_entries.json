So far, Cameron's is three for three for this Avatar films, but it's unlikely it will reach $2 billion like the first two movies did, and this could mean Disney may be hesitant to greenlight Avatars 4 and 5. In other movies news, Netflix reportedly wants a 17-day window for theatrically-released movies, far shorter than the standard 45-day window. With Netflix attempting to buy Warner Bros., this could put the streamer at odds with filmmakers already working in the WB system on movies like the DC Universe and Godzilla. And in related news, Leonardo DiCaprio has voiced in opinion on the theatrical experience, wondering if it'll turn into something for 'niche' audiences.\n\n#IGN",
