So i&#39;m in a current search for THE browser, people says brave is the best, zen is very cool too, waterfox, etc, etc, etc. I&#39;m looking a browser where i can see videos and streams with almost no delay, low ram usage (chrome has been the ram abuser, i don&#39;t know if still is), hope i can download chrome extensions, and preferable some customisation on the UI.

I really hope you like it, guys! Also, the extension is now live in the Chrome Web Store.

No right-clicking, no menus, no clicking icons. Just select and it&#39;s there.</p> <p>I get paid in USD but live in a country with a different currency, so I&#39;m constantly having to convert prices and it&#39;s a huge pain to do it manually every time.</p> <p>Does any other browser do this natively? Or is there a lightweight extension that replicates this exact behavior?
