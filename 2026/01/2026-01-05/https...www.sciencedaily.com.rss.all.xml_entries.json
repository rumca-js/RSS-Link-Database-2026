        "description": "New research shows gut bacteria can directly influence how the brain develops and functions. When scientists transferred microbes from different primates into mice, the animals\u2019 brains began to resemble those of the original host species. Microbes from large-brained primates boosted brain energy and learning pathways, while others triggered very different patterns. The results suggest gut microbes may have played a hidden role in shaping the human brain\u2014and could influence mental health.",

MCL1 actively drives cancer metabolism by controlling the powerful mTOR growth pathway, tying survival and energy use together. This insight explains why MCL1-targeting drugs can be effective\u2014but also why they sometimes damage the heart. Researchers have now identified a way to reduce that risk, potentially unlocking safer cancer therapies.",

These events have accelerated in recent years, creating strange triangular fracture patterns and flooding the glacier\u2019s base with water in just hours. Some drainages even pushed the ice upward from below, like a blister forming under the glacier. Scientists now wonder whether the glacier can ever return to its previous seasonal rhythm.",
