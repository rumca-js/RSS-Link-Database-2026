        "description": "I'm not quite sure how StarRupture will ultimately measure up against either Satisfactory or Factorio in terms of pure automation in the long run, but that's the thing: It doesn't necessarily have to. \n\nAs long as it can expand and improve on its own gameplay loop, where combat, exploration and base-building function as one harmonious whole, then StarRupture could very well serve as a compelling third option. For now, if you're looking for a first-person automation title to fill the hole left by Satisfactory, it's worth checking out.",

As games become bigger, more complex, and increasingly expensive to make, delays \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 are part of the process. 2026 has some huge launches pencilled in, yet several high-profile titles are carrying enough uncertainty, production baggage, or external pressure that slipping into 2027 feels like a real possibility. \n\nHere are five of the biggest games we think stand a chance of not making it out this year.",
