Would any of you be interested in alpha-testing an ad-free, 100% private/on-device algorithmic RSS reader? If so, reach out to [<a href=\"mailto:hello@kitpicks.com\">hello@kitpicks.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:hello@kitpicks.com\">hello@kitpicks.com</a>) </p> <p><strong>Some more questions</strong> to maybe prompt some thoughts:</p> <p>Is the main problem with algorithmic feeds that they&#39;re not 100% predictable? Is it that they optimize for scrolling/time-in-app/time-spent-looking-at-ads as opposed to quality clicks? (Or do they somehow otherwise optimize for &quot;the wrong thing&quot;?) Is it that most algorithms involve some centralized data collection of your reading behavior? Something else?</p> <p>If you&#39;re maybe open to an algorithmic fee",

So over the last year I&#39;ve been struggling with a problem, namely that I want to write a public feed on my newsletter/site, but also write private articles. I&#39;m using Ghost, but used WordPress before that. </p> <p>What I want, is a way for premium subscribers to access my private content via RSS. </p> <p>Yes... the spirit of RSS is that it&#39;s free, but it&#39;s still a problem that I&#39;ve been wrestling with. Patreon has a way to do this, but I don&#39;t want my content locked behind there right now.</p> <p>So my friend and I build a solution, Lochy.org. </p> <p>We just put it out for early access last night, and we&#39;d love any initial feedback. We&#39;re trying to figure out if this is a solution to a problem others have, or if it&#39;s just a problem I&#39;ve been facing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mrdesignguy\"> /u/mrdesignguy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
