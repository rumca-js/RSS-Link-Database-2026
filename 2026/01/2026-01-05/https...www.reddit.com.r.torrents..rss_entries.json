        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello you all</p> <p>Over the years, I resurrected a couple of public torrents that had lost their active seeds, and recently, I resurrected another one that felt more rewarding. I was looking for a TV Show from Colombia that streamed on HBO Max in the year of 2021, and it was not available on any private trackers I am on. I found public releases in 720p torrent with active seeds and two 1080p torrents, but no seeds.</p> <p>So I decided to fill a request on a private tracker for a 1080p release of the show, and less than 24h it was available for download. I noticed it was the same release I had from a public torrent, rechecked the files, and almost all worked well. The public torrent got stuck at 99%, so I am not a seeder in fact, but all files work fine, so I think it&#39;s enough and already uploaded 22GB and counting.</p> <p>This made me curious if any of you have a similar case of resurrecting dead torrents?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte",
