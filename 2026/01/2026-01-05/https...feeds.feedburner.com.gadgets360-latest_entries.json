By combining observations from ground-based telescopes across three continents with data from ESA\u2019s Gaia spacecraft, researchers determined the planet\u2019s distance and found it to be about the mass of Saturn. The discovery provides one of the clearest measurements of a free-floating planet to date and suggests that such starless worlds may be far more common than previously thought, offering new clues about planetary formation and evolution.",

        "description": "Gravitational waves, first directly detected in 2015, have opened a new way of observing the universe. Now, physicist Ralf Sch\u00fctzhold of HZDR proposes going a step further\u2014actively interacting with these ripples in spacetime using powerful lasers. His theoretical scheme builds on LIGO-style interferometers, where intense laser pulses bounce repeatedly along kilometer-scale arms. As a gravitational wave passes, the light could exchange tiny amounts of energy in the form of gravitons, subtly shifting its frequency. Detecting such changes would provide rare experimental evidence that gravity behaves quantum mechanically. If successful, the idea could help bridge the long-standing gap between general relativity and quantum physics.",
