        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m trying to set up my Laravel environment using Laradock on an Ubuntu server, but the build process for the workspace container is failing. I am using the terminal inside Webmin, and you can see the error in the attached image. It seems like it&#39;s failing during the apt-get install or PHP extension installation phase. A few points: 1. I am only using Docker and Nginx. 2. I cannot modify the core Docker configuration files. 3. I keep getting build failures (as shown in the red text). Has anyone faced this issue with Laradock on Ubuntu before? How can I fix this build error? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wafik_alseyah\"> /u/Wafik_alseyah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1q7oczm/issue_with_laradock_workspace_build_on_ubuntu/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1q7oczm/issue_with_laradock_work",

It kept uninstalling itself, no pop-ups of crashes or logs that I could find. Today it did that 4 times already. I have a MacBook Pro with M4, 48GB RAM, currently on Tahoe 26.2. With the Docker issue I\u2019ve also noticed that my Dock (apps bar) resets to its default each time that Docker disappears. (It all is very annoying) I\u2019ve tried only resetting the Dock with killall Dock, but this didn\u2019t fix anything.
