For more than two decades, C++ has served as the workhorse of high-performance, low-power, and low-latency software across industries. Its raw speed and unconstrained flexibility have made C++ the go-to language for and backbone of large-scale software development. Recently, however, software engineering priorities have shifted significantly toward safety. While C++ enables the creation of secure and correct programs, its traditional focus has favored performance over safety guarantees. As the software landscape evolves, C++ faces a crucial inflection point. To maintain its unparalleled stature, C++ must embrace various safety mechanisms along with safety-by-default principles to support a broader developer ecosystem while preserving the performance capabilities that experts will continue to demand. This talk will examine C++'s evolution toward safety-first developmen",
