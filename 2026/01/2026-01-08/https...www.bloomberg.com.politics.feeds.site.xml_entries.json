Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.\n\nOn today's show, President Trump has demanded a more than 50-percent increase in the US military budget to $1.5 trillion and also threatened defense companies over their shareholder payouts.\n\nElsewhere, protests have erupted in Minneapolis, after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in a car during a confrontation. President Trump cast it as an act of self-defense, alleging the victim acted in a disorderly and obstructive way. The Mayor of Minneapolis has called on ICE to leave the city. \n\nToday's guests: Edward Sterck, Research Director at World Platinum Investment Council. (Source: Bloomberg)",
