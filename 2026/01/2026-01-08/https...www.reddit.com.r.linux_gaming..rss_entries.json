That\u00b4s why I want to make a post on the sub of my country to show these people that you can actually play games on Linux.</p> <p>What important things do I need to mention in this post? What are the best distro\u00b4s to mention? What would you suggest not to mention?</p> <p>Love to hear from you and hopefully this future post will stimulate more people to switch to Linux!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Little_Protection434\"> /u/Little_Protection434 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1q6x9vf/a_important_reason_why_people_dont_switch_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1q6x9vf/a_important_reason_why_people_dont_switch_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The problem is that when I first opened Vinegar, it simply crashed. I managed to change the Nouveau driver to one compatible with my GTX 750 Ti. However, after doing that, Vinegar wouldn&#39;t open in Vulkan, but it would in other renderers (except OpenGL). I don&#39;t know how to solve this problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Popular-Milk-5115\"> /u/Popular-Milk-5115 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1q6x7jy/vinegar_isnt_turning_the_vulkan/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1q6x7jy/vinegar_isnt_turning_the_vulkan/\">[comments]</a></span>",
