I would leave my morning uni class and go get coffee with a friend and then when I pull my laptop out to take some notes down before the next class, it wouldn&#39;t wake up. Kind of thing where you mash the caps key or press the space bar a few times, but after 1-2 minutes I gave up and had to hard power off, and turn on the machine again to get it to get back into linux. This issue was so bad that I considered going back to windows all together because after two months I was tired of it, but t",

It originated as a fully free-software alternative when KDE&#39;s Qt toolkit was proprietary, and many users/distros stuck with Gnome after KDE 4&#39;s rocky release in the late 2000s.
