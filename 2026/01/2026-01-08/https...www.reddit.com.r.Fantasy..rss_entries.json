I went from feeling like my intelligence, comprehension and knowledge of the English language is being challenged by James Islington to reading such bad, repetitive prose and Gwynne holding my hand in every single sentence. I read over 400 books in my life and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m exaggerating when I say this is one of the worst written books I have ever read. Pacing is horrible, chapters are too short, descriptions of people, landscape, battles, deaths are all the same. Everyone is &quot;bald except one long braid.&quot; Everyone is &quot;holding the weapon in their hand.&quot; Everyone is wearing a brynja. We get it. It makes me want to DNF.

It was a book series with an mc who had a soul consuming sword that made him younger/gave him energy. In the start of the first book I remember him being old and stuck in a tavern of some sort in a magical storm. In the tavern was secretly also a where wolf murderer, when he kills the wherewolf with his sword he turns young again and the adventure starts. The mc traveled with a group in the books and later on in the series he turns blind temporarily and the sword helps him see (kind of) by showing him souls of the people surrounding him. Also the sword helps him fight. </p> <p>Does anybody have any clue what book this might be?

Whether they succeed or fail in that is not that important for me, but I would like that to be important for their character arc. Something like Jaime Lannister in ASOIAF is ideal. But also, character trying to overcome some other type of injury/disability that they didn&#39;t have at the start of the book, like Adolin Kholin in Wind and Truth, is also something I would like to read. Alternatively, a book where a magic user loses a part of their power and has to find a way around that also works. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vin_Mistborn\"> /u/Vin_Mistborn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1q7puvc/looking_for_a_book_where_a_major_character_has_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www",

The type of magic that one of the protagonists, Agneiszka, uses was also something I enjoyed: less focus on specific incantations or words and more focus on the feeling of the magic and the intention of the spell.

I&#39;ve loved them since I saw Agent Cody Banks when it first came out, and have consumed lots of spy media since. However, spy thriller fantasy has been rather more difficult to get a hold of and I am trying to write a book incorporating those themes. Most &quot;spy thriller&quot; fantasy books are really assassin books and that&#39;s not quite what I&#39;m looking for. So if there are any recommendations for spy thriller fantasy that lean more into spy than assassin that would be fantastic. Bonus points for secondary world.</p> <p>I think the closest thing I&#39;ve come to what I&#39;m looking for is The Rook, but I want yo feel like I&#39;m reading a spy novel, not another assassin novel.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dracoe44\"> /u/Dracoe44 </a> <br/> <span><a href=",

I liked the first book a great deal, despite the pacing being a trifle too slow for my taste. I was excited to start book two, but the romance parts are incredibly boring and quite cheesy too. I guess it\u2019s not that strange for a young person to be so in love, but I wanted to read about <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">FitzChivalry being an assassin and exploring the Wit (hopefully the Skill as well)</span> and I couldn\u2019t care less about <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Molly.</span> I\u2019ve been slogging through these parts and hoping they end soon.</p> <p>Anyway. Please suggest me a book with similar plot points (I\u2019d like something where people can bond with animals), high fantasy, but less romance (none if possible). I\u2019d rather it not be YA, as I\u2019m not interested in the genre save for a few exceptions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Short stories are an art like any other, and those who wield them well are masters. I used to discount them: why would anyone write a short story when they can just... write a real book instead? Well, the joke&#39;s on me. From Borges to VanderMeer, short stories are the perfect way to explore conceits that might not make it into a full novel. And those who do it well can pack as much detail in 14 or 15 pages a some authors can do in 500.</p> <p>With that preface done, here are some of my favorites.
