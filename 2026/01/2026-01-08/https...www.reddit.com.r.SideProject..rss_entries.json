What surprised me is that it doesn\u2019t feel like learning, it feels like playing a game. I actually look forward to opening it every day, keeping my streak alive, and trying to stay near the top of the leaderboard. That sense of fun and competitiveness really hooked me.</p> <p>At some point I started thinking: what if learning to code felt like this?</p> <p>A few days ago, I decided to try this idea as a personal project. I challenged myself to build a very small Duolingo-style game for learning programming, starting with Python. The goal isn\u2019t to teach everything or replace a full curriculum, it\u2019s to encourage daily practice, keep lessons small, and avoid that overwhelmed feeling that makes people quit.</p> <p>I built a rough beta in about 48 hours.

Others are surprisingly welcoming to builders. 3. <strong>Timing is a black box.</strong> I posted in what I thought was a dead sub at 2 PM my time, and it got 50 co",

Super excited because this is my first ever iOS app lol. <strong>Feel free to check it out here:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sono-ai-transcribe-summarize/id6757373812\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sono-ai-transcribe-summarize/id6757373812</a> </p> <p>I noticed that a lot of existing AI notetaker apps with transcription and summarization have super high subscription costs (over $100+/year) so I wanted to create a fully local alternative with lifetime pricing. The app runs OpenAI&#39;s Whisper and Meta&#39;s Llama locally on-device, which means your data is never sent to the cloud. You can create a new recording or upload an audio/video file to transcribe.</p> <p>I really hope you enjoy :) Please let me know if you have any feedback or questions, I would love to continue improving the app.</p> </div><!-- ",
