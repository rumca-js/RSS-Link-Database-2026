        "description": "The West has been living inside a single moral story since World War II \u2014 a story built to prevent catastrophe by suppressing identity, nationalism, and power. That story is now collapsing, and the fallout is everywhere: culture wars that cut across left and right, former allies who no longer share reality, and arguments that can\u2019t be resolved because there\u2019s no common framework left to argue inside. This conversation traces how that post-war consensus formed, why Israel became its symbolic pressure point, and what happens when a civilisation loses the story that once held it together.\n\n[STREAMED]\n\nGo to https://rumble.com/premium/BRAND and join the movement.\n\nENTER THE REBORN GIVEAWAY \u2014 I\u2019m giving away a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 plus $10,000 cash through my new brand, Reborn.
