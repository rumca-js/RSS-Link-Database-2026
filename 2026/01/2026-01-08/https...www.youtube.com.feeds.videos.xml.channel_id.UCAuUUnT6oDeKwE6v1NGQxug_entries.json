        "description": "2026 is a tipping point year, says Ian Bremmer, founder of Eurasia Group. Highlighting the top risks that await the world, he breaks down the US military extraction of Venezuela leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and explains why US President Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of the \u201cDonroe doctrine\u201d kicks off the most uncertain geopolitical environment in decades. With stark insights on what's to come in Europe, Russia and China, this is a can't-miss look at the volatile world order.",

        "description": "Scientists estimate that 80 percent of life on Earth is still unknown to humanity. But as global temperatures rise, habitats shrink and food and water sources dry up, we're losing these species faster than we can discover them. AI naturalist Sara Beery reveals how the knowledge to study (and save) the natural world may already exist, buried in millions of images, recordings and observations. We just need to learn how to read them before it's too late. (Recorded at TED Countdown and Bezos Earth Fund on September 24, 2025)\n\nCountdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world.
