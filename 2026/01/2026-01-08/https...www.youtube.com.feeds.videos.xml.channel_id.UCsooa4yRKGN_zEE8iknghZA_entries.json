        "description": "Follow Alice Sutton, a servant in Edwardian England, as she prepares the estate for a visitor and fights for women's suffrage.\n\n--\n\nIt\u2019s just before dawn in 1906 at Wroxton Abbey, and 16-year-old Alice Sutton\u2019s mind is already spinning. The underhousemaid has a full day ahead of her as the estate prepares for the evening\u2019s guest: Prince Arthur. This is Alice\u2019s chance to prove herself to her new employers \u2014 but there are other forces at play. Stephanie Honchell Smith details a day in the life of a servant in Edwardian England.\n\nLesson by Stephanie Honchell Smith, directed by Anton Bogaty.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on",
