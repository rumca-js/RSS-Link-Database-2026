Ever since I first heard about self-driving cars, I&#39;ve had this fantasy to hop in the backseat, tell my car where to go, and just sleep. Better yet, wake up at my destination or even just a 30-minute power nap on my commute instead of weaving in and out of traffic.</p> <p>This week, David Moss(a Tesla owner) drove 2,732 miles from LA to South Carolina using FSD v14.2. According to him, he had zero interventions and zero close calls across 24 states. Yeah, Elon promised this in 2016 and said it would happen by 2017 so it&#39;s 8 years late LOL but it actually happened. You still can&#39;t legally sleep (FSD is still &quot;supervised&quot;), but unsupervised mode is targeted for 2026. For the first time, this doesn&#39;t feel like &quot;someday&quot; anymore. Anyone else been waiting for this?</p> <p>Full breakdown if you are curious: <a href=\"https://everydayaiblog.com/tesla-fsd-coast-to-coast-autonomous-drive/\">https://everydayaiblog",

These junctions act as a natural memristors and thus, reproducing this effect in artificial aqueous systems is crucial for mimicking neural functions and advancing neuromorphic computing. Herein, we successfully demonstrated the memristive effects through the spatial confinement of water and ions within a biomimetic nanochannel, using two distinct stimulation mechanisms (i) divalent-ion screening and (ii) pH-driven deprotonation. In both cases, broken symmetry within the medium coupled with surface effects, lead to hysteretic ion transport.

In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction.

I\u2019m currently in classes that require lots of paper writing on subjects such as nursing theory and literature reviews. I\u2019m wanting to get recommendations for the best AI platform that increases productivity when writing papers. This last semester I primarily used ChatGPT, uploaded the rubric, the topic I wanted to focus on and any other requirements and had it write me a draft paper to use as a visual guide to write my own paper. Of note: I am not asking for an AI to write my paper so I can copy and paste it and turn it in. I just want a good one that can write a really good example/draft paper, learn the writing style/workflows of the class, and find me good sources to use. I find that I write better when I have a visual aid/example paper to reference when writing. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything better than ChatGPT out there for this. Thanks in advance!",
