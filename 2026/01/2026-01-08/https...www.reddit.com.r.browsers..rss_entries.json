It also moves my Quick Launch icons around all on its own. Sure, Edge works great but it really feels like it&#39;s not very user-oriented. And from what I&#39;m reading, Microsoft is going to continue to integrate Copilot into Edge more and more. And yes, I&#39;ve disabled everything Copilot-related in settings.</p> <p>I don&#39;t mind Copilot as a standalone app, but I want my browser to be as predictable as any other app. I don&#39;t want to see a different view or have to answer questions each time I open Excel or Word either. Has anyone found ways to make Edge behave consistently? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Careful-One5190\"> /u/Car",

I like Safari but it doesn&#39;t have the split browser feature, unfortunately.</p> <p>What I&#39;d love to have is each split to have its own tabs. That way I could queue up a few YouTube videos on the left and do my work on the right. I hope I&#39;m explaining that right...</p> <p>I now just open two instnces, effectively making my own split Works fine... but it would be cleaner if it was in a single instance.</p> <p>Anyone else agree that this would be neat?
