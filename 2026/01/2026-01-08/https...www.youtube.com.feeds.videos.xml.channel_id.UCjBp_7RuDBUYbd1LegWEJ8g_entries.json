        "description": "Erosion is a time-looping open-world roguelike that fuses chaotic action and meaningful narrative in a living post-apocalyptic Wild West, where every death advances a decade. \n\nJourney across time to save your daughter from a ruthless warlord, where failure means another chance, but at a devastating cost. Explore a faction-divided wasteland to build your arsenal and reshape the fates of its eccentric inhabitants across shifting timelines. Join a chicken cult, steal a slick new ride, race it to earn Cheddar, then gamble it all away in the Al Cashino. Descend into the mysterious Pillar to battle through chaotic, destructible dungeons, fighting to get one step closer to saving your daughter or losing her entirely to time itself.\n\nhttps://www.xbox.com/games/store/erosion/9n5rhwd1pbzj\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO XBOX: https://xbx.lv/2EEjmaR \n\nFOLLOW XBOX \nhttps://twitter.com/xbox \nhttps://www.facebook.com/xbox \nhttps://www.instagram.com/xbox/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@xbox\nhttps://www.threads.net/@xbox\nh",
