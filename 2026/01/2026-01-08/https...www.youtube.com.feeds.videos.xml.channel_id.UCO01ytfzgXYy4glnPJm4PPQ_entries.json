        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a left wing agitator is killed by ICE agents while trying to run one of them over with her car. Now Democrat officials are doing everything they can to turn this into another George Floyd moment. Also, Mamdani's communist housing official who considers private property rights to be a white supremacist conspiracy, runs away crying when she's asked about it. And Donald Trump says that he will ban corporations from buying up housing units. Is this an attack on the free markets, or a way to protect the free markets?\n\nEp. 1714\n\n-- -- --\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos daily. https://www.youtube.com/@mattwalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://dwplus.watch/MattWalshMemberExclusive\n\n-- -- --\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2009020845239533590?s=20\nhttps://x.com/Cernovich/status/2009038333620473912?s=20\nhttps://x.com/Cernovich/status/2009041195717284106?s=20\nhttps://x.com/chiIIum/status/200902",
