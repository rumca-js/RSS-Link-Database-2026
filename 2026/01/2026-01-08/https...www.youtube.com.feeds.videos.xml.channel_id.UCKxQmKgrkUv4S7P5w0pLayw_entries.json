Jason Todd is Batman. Tim Drake is Batman. And to complete his mission, Bruce Wayne will have to fight both of them. The former Robins aren't giving up without a fight, and it will take everything Batman has \u2014 and then some \u2014 in order to defeat them.\n\nDoes Batman have what it takes to defeat both of his pupils, or have the students become the masters?\n\nFOLLOW ME HERE!\n\u25b8 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ComicsExplainedSub\n\u25b8 Twitter: http://twitter.com/Comicsexplained\n\u25b8 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/comicsexplained\n\nVideos Everyone Loves:\n\u25b8 New To Invincible?
