        "description": "Requiem isn\u2019t reinventing the series\u2019 formula, but coalescing Resident Evil\u2019s fear to the rhythm of helplessness and response. If the developer can keep this balance steady, then Requiem may emerge as more than just Resident Evil 9, but where the series finally becomes whole. There\u2019s light in the black, but how\u2019s your fear of the dark?",

        "description": "Coming back from the Holidays, it's so nice to see ARC Raiders doing so well. Topping Steam charts for the final week, reportedly crossing 12 million sales this past weekend \u2013 heck, even the news that many studios have approached Embark about film and TV adaptations is great.
