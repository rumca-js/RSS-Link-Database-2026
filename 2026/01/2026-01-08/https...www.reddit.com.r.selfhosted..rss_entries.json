While I appreciate that I can plug and play most Github plugins into it, it has very poor API support for the CI portion. I want to up my game on utilizing AI to help me in all aspects, and at the moment this is a gap. Without the API support, at best I would have to come up with something web-scrapy and kludgy.</p> <p>Does anybody run their own CI who are impressed with its API capabilities? I used Jenkins back when it was Hudson and using that now feels like I am writing code in COBOL, but perhaps there is something I am overlooking. Gitlab also appears to be very bloaty and not ideal for self-hosting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",

So I&#39;d love a little page I can display if I have to shut the server down.
