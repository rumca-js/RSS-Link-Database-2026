Vance said the officer \u201cnearly had his life ended\u201d after being dragged by a car six months ago, causing an injury requiring more than 30 stitches in his leg.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: h",
