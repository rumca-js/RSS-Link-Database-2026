I received my pre-order right before Christmas and have had a blast playing it with my family and friends. Definitely worth it, had so many riled up, heated and memorable games!!!</p> <p>The game involves collecting sets of cards kinda like the bean game, but is heavily based on negotiating and making deals with other players even allows you to go into debt. It has an accountability system that is player incentivized with financial benefit to the player catching people breaking the rules and a financial loss to the player that is caught. The game even features political influence and the ability for corruption but that is solely up to the player that can be weaponized but there are checks and balances.</p> <p>The game is a lot of fun with the bare minimum of 2 players but it gets intense with more players; even though the box says a max of 7 players we\u2019ve played with 10 people",

In a 1v1 game, the opponent would be free to take all the actions they want with no interference until they are out of resources.</p> <p>- A variant of this is that passing does not lock you of acting for the round, but gives the opponent the opportunity to also pass and trigger the end of round. If the opponent decides to act, the round keeps going.</p> <p>- After all players have passed, there may be some kind of end of round resolution and then a new round starts.<",

I\u2019m thinking of games where the table is constantly engaged with one another through negotiation, shifting alliances, competition over limited spaces or objectives, and decisions that directly impact other players plans. Whether it\u2019s diplomacy and table talk, conflict over the board, or systems that force players to react to one another, these games tend to feel very different from heads-down personal board optimization.</p> <p>What makes a game feel truly interactive to you?

The game is Munchkin, if anyone\u2019s wondering!</p> <p>I usually swear by Gamegenic Matte, but I often have trouble with stacks sliding. I was wondering if Primes might be better.
