It&#39;s had a good run until a few days ago when I noticed the left stick was drifting. I thought I&#39;d look into a Hall effect controller until I realised this one already has it. I bounce between this one, my Joycons from way back in 2018, and a PS5 controller also from around 2021 depending on the game. But neither of those latter two have had any drift issues despite the widely reported issues others have had.</p> <p>Do Hall effect controllers just have a shorter lifespan in exchange for better precision? Or has mine just started experiencing issues sooner than it&#39;s meant to?

That they would often crash, your PC wouldn\u2019t have the correct drivers or .dll\u2019s, the load times in general to get them going where agonizingly slow, everything was basically an RTS, etc compared to modern games that more or less play smoothly (assuming you also don\u2019t have a boatload of mods installed). </p> <p>But, I might be wrong and am just curious what your experiences were like. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mad_Season_1994\"> /u/Mad_Season_1994 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q7hgqx/for_those_of_you_who_grew_up_playing_pc_games_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://w",

It&#39;s basically just a Far Cry game, right down to the thoroughly underwhelming campaign, so I was kinda shocked how much I enjoyed the expansion. It&#39;s funny how much you learn to appreciate things like &quot;having actual cutscenes&quot;, &quot;decent writing&quot;, enemy variety etc. when you haven&#39;t had any in a while, and they made a smart choice pivoting more towards chaotic action over the mediocre stealth. Still got problems (namely the difficulty or lack-there-of) but I&#39;m impressed that by the end I was actually invested in the story and characters who I&#39;d mostly dismissed in the main game.</p> <p>This seems to be a Ubisoft special - release the game in a state that causes everyone to immediately write ",
