        "description": "Antananarivo Prison is one of Madagascar\u2019s most overcrowded and dangerous detention centers. Built for far fewer inmates than it holds today, this crumbling facility is infamous for filthy living conditions, severe overcrowding, and its rat infestation. Prisoners sleep packed together on concrete floors, sanitation is almost nonexistent, and disease spreads fast in the suffocating heat.\n\n#prisonlife #truecrime #crimestories #documentary #youtubeshorts #shorts",
