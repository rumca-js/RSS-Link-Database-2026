Judgment was due to come in Jeddah but it will be put off for another day at least, and instead of the sack there may be a medal waiting at the end of a month spent on edge after Real defeated Atl\u00e9tico 2-1. Goals from Fede Valverde and Rodrygo set up another Super Cup meeting with Barcelona on Sunday night, opportunity and obligation in one.</p><p>On a night when Madrid scored after 77 seconds, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s last opportunity to get a result they probably deserved and force a penalty shootout slipped agonisingly away with only 10 more seconds remaining. Juli\u00e1n Alvarez had it, Antoine Griezmann almost did, but, in at last, a shot from the former just evaded the latter. As the ball bounced past the post, it took Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s hopes with it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/08/valverde-and-ro",

I originally put that down to the lack of time and attention I\u2019d given those poor plants, but I\u2019m now starting to wonder if the soil in my raised garden beds overlooking Lyme Bay in Dorset is actually right for them.</p><p>I\u2019m not giving up just yet, though, and this year I\u2019ll be trying different varieties in a different bed that I\u2019ve prepared and composted over the winter with seaweed mulch. As luck would have it, however, my friend Rob Corbett came to the rescue a couple of weeks ago by giving me several specimens when he delivered some wine from <a href=\"https://www.castlewoodvineyard.co.uk/\">his Castlewood vineyard</a> a few miles away in east Devon.
