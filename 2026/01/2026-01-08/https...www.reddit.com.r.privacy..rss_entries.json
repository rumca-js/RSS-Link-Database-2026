The email that leaked got deleted together with my email account. After that I stopped all collaboration with the organization.</p> <p>I considered that account dead, however I suspect the IT guy reopened it with a new service provider to ensure my correspondence wasn&#39;t lost. It might be they have been reading my account for months now. I doubt they have wrote emails in my name but that&#39;s a risk too.</p> <p>So here I am wondering the severity of this privacy breach and whether this constitutes an offence worth bringing in front of the law.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Loose-Chef\"> /u/Loose-Chef </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1q7qqf0/eu_whistleblower_faced_a_privacy_breach_worth/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=",
