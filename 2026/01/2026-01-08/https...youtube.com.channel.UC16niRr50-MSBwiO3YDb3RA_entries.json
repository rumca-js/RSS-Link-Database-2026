        "description": "People who come off weight-loss injections such as Mounjaro or Wegovy can regain their lost pounds four times faster than those who stop conventional dieting and exercising, new research suggests.\n \nThe British Medical Journal has published data which suggests overweight people can shed about a fifth of their body weight when using jabs.\n \nBut once they quit they regain 0.8 kg every month, on average, meaning they return to their pre-treatment weight in a year-and-a-half.\n \nDoctors say more studies of the longer-term effects of new slimming jabs would be helpful.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "A US immigration agent has shot dead a 37-year-old woman in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.\n \nFederal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly.\n \nVideos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. The FBI is investigating.\n \nHundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the White House's crackdown on illegal immigration.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#ICE #BBCNews",
