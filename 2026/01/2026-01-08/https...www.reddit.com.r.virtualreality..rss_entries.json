Somthing for a while i wondered is why there were a lack of third person games inspired by the wii era of Zelda so curious if anyone has done somthing like that since. Lot of what the wii motion controls wanted but weren&#39;t able to accomplish basically seem solved by vr motion controls. While I never played skyward sword or saw much of it I have been told it did pretty good at having the hack and slashing feel like you were doing it with your own arms (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/8N8hwJepGCk?si=zg1C-0hnSSep-rjh\">https://youtube.com/shorts/8N8hwJepGCk?si=zg1C-0hnSSep-rjh</a> example of gameplay).
