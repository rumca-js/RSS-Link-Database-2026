It sounds like pure fiction, but at CES 2026, that idea felt a little more real. A company called Ventiva caught my colleague Adam Patrick Murray\u2019s attention when he tried out their fanless cooling tech running on a Lenovo Legion Go 2. And yes\u2014it was actually silent. No fan noise, no ramping up under load. Just a handheld doing its thing without sounding stressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick here is Ventiva\u2019s ionic device, which ditches fans entirely. Instead of using fans, it moves heat away in a totally different way using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kcWJE4_8bw\">ionic cooling</a>. That means no spinning, no vibrations. And, just to be clear, this isn\u2019t something you can actually buy yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><di",
