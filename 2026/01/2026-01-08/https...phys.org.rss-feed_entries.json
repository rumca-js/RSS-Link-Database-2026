The study, published in Environment & Health, focused on Scopoli's shearwaters breeding on Linosa, a small and remote volcanic island in the Sicilian Channel. Scientists found that widespread contaminants such as mercury and certain PFAS compounds affect the function of mitochondria, tiny cellular powerhouses that generate energy for activities from flight to reproduction.",
