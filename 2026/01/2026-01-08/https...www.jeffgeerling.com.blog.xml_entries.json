        "description": "<p>For the past decade, I've used <a href=\"https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog\">Mailhog</a> for local email debugging. Besides working on web applications that deal with email, I've long used email as the primary notification system for comments on the blog.</p>\n<p>I built an <a href=\"https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog\">Ansible role for Mailhog</a>, and it was one of the main features of <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2015/major-improvements-drupal-vm/\">Drupal VM</a>, a popular local development environment for Drupal I sunset 3 years ago.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like <a href=\"https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/466\">Mailhog has not been maintained</a> for four years now. It still <em>works</em>, but something as complex as an email debugging environment needs ongoing maintenance to stay relevant.</p>",
