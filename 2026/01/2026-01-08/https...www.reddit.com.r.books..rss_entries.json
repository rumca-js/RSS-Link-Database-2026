I especially love his long winded and sometimes even lyrical style and the themes he tends to explore such as the interiority of others and what it means to confide in someone.

It&#39;s always depicted as something that destroys or threatens the survival of the village &quot;Eddy&quot; lives in. I write eddy and not Edouard, because in this book it&#39;s clear that the amount of irony Edouard uses, implies that his childhood self hasn&#39;t &quot;reached&quot; that level yet. Therefore I think it&#39;s important to separate his two selves. Anyway, about the nature. Only three times he depicts nature as something beautiful, or rather maybe as something neutral. I think it symbolises his unique ability to change his class, which none of the other inhabitants are able to (the exception is his mother). I personally think this reading is good, but I&#39;m curious as to what you think or if you found more depictions of nature that were positive in that book?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",

One thing I&#39;ve noticed, even in the shorter novels, there&#39;s always a lull right before the final image/monologue, as I suppose happens with most novels, but it seems to be more prevalent in the modernist period. With that being said, almost all of these sluggish sections seem entirely intentional, almost as a dare to the reader. Why? </p> <p><em>Ulysses</em>: If anything, I feel like the least memorable sections of this monumental novel are the opening episode, Telemechus, and the Eumeus episode towards the end of the novel. Of course, Eumeus is the episode where Stephen and Bloom rest before returning home, so it&#39;s meant to be tiresome. </p> <p><em>To the Lighthouse</em>: the opening section, &quot;The Window,&quot; is easily one of the high points of Modernism, but the final episode, &quot;the Lighthouse,&quot; is a slog, comparatively, ",
