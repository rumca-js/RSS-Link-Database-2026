Now what I am looking for is a setup that can automate or even download new books as they show up. On daily basis I use z-lib or welib to get most of the stuff but this requires me to know something is out and look for a specific book. What I would like to do is set autora, geners or other factors and get stuff flowing in. Is it possible? If so can anyone guide me? I&#39;m fine with setting up something like nzbgeek if it&#39;s needed. Key constrain is I would like to get the ebooks mainly in Polish language and a lot of aurora I read is also Polish.

I use Smarttube because I want to block youtube&#39;s unskippable ads, and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t want to skip intros/outros, self promotion, or anything else, but those settings are set by default in the sponsor block settings. When I installed Smarttube, I turn all of those settings off immediately, but recently (since the update following the malware issue recently I believe), these settings will automatically revert themselves every time I open the app. Does anyone have a solution for this, or possibly an alternative app?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imail724\"> /u/imail724 </a> <br/> <s",
