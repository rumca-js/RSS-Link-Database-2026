Via IGN Poland, sources have apparently been aware of plans to drop a new expansion featuring the desert region Zerrikania. CD Projekt Red has not confirmed anything, but they have reportedly been dropping hints. In other news, Nintendo has revealed a new set of Joy-Con 2 dropping at the same time as the new Mario Tennis Fever game. \"Light Green\" and \"Light Purple\" will retail as a pair for $100. And finally, a new Xbox Developer Direct is dropping on January 22, and will give us first gameplay of Forza Horizon 6 and a fresh look at the Fable reboot.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

However, splitting it into three distinct routes makes it all much easier to digest. While our main hero is overshadowed by the other protagonists early on, the story eventually finds a satisfying way to weave its paths together, and ultimately sticks the landing. The new mechanics in both the turn-based and real-time combat are also welcome additions that continue to refine a battle system that was already a lot of fun. And while its cliffhanger ending will likely be divisive, Trails Beyond the Horizon has certainly built an exciting launchpad for what comes next.",

The map features a timer that seems to line up with the finale of Fallout Season 2, but with evidence already out there that a Fallout 3 remake is in the works, fans are hoping this leads to an official announcement, or maybe even a remake/remaster of Fallout: New Vegas. In other news, games industry analysts have revealed the most-played games of 2025, and surprise surprise, it's the same list from 2024. Call of Duty, GTA V, Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite are the most-played games at least two years in a row. And speaking of Fornite, the South Park collab has leaked, and the gameplay features a clever way to showcase fourth-graders in the game.",
