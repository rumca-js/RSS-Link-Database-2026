I\u2019m looking for books about automotive mechanics as I work in the automotive world and just have interest in learning more about vehicles. I\u2019m looking for books that teach about diagnostics, electrical, how systems work and can fail, and emissions.

So I want to buy another book like Fourth Wing, but I recently bought the first book in the Blood and Ash series, which I barely finished. I loved the action, the pace, the variety of magic,the dragons and medival theme in Fourth Wing. But I didn&#39;t find those things in Blood and Ash, especially towards the end. Poppy&#39;s thoughts made me hate the character. The series doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be like Enemies to Lover; it just needs to have a well-developed love story,MC and side-characters. And as for the MC, I didn&#39;t like Poppy either. She seemed like a character who only saw lust towards the end of the book, I want the MC to be like Violet, not Poppy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkSiJeN123\"> /u/OkSiJeN123 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

I&#39;m really interested as to how religious belief varied in this era, because my default is to imagine it as uniformly Christian, but I&#39;d love to learn more about how much pagan beliefs survived, how prevalent was atheism/agnosticism etc. I know there were a lot of different approaches/&quot;heresies&quot; to Christian belief and the pagan areas of the Baltics etc, but I&#39;d love to learn more about this whole subject. Any ideas very welcomed and I don&#39;t mind if they&#39;re more academic in tone either </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Farfalla992\"> /u/Farfalla992 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q782ny/books_about_religious_diversity_in_medievalearly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",

It&#39;s been a long time coming, and I&#39;m incredibly excited to get started. I know the book is better from what I&#39;ve read from reviews (without giving too much detail), but I want to make sure I&#39;m reading Deaver novels in a correct format if there are any recommendations. </p> <p>I&#39;ve come across The Skin Collector that seems to tie into The Bone Collector&#39;s dynamic, but I&#39;m not entirely sure, everytime I try to find some substantial book order online, I get mixed answers. I was hoping to get a perspective from his fans on here on what your recommendations are for how I should dive into his novels, if there are any. </p> <p>Thanks in advance! \ud83d\udcd6</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I am looking for recommendations for a book to read over the next for months before/during a big move across the country. My husband and I have lived in Indiana our entire lives, but have decided to leave and move to CA, primarily for me to start a PhD program, but also to start a new chapter of our lives together. Leaving all of our friends and family will be tough but it\u2019s a journey we are incredibly excited about. I would like to find a book, non-fiction, about major life transitions or moving. Something meditative, inspiring, motivational, etc. I come from a pretty tight knit community, so while it is very much needed, it will be a difficult transition in my life. The book could be just about anything, a memoir, poetry, motivational, whatever you got! Or maybe, even something about California specifically? Idk be creative I guess lol thank you all</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/loganj_201",

My favorite author being John Fante, here&#39;s a quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>And then he shuddered as you do when cold metal touches your flank, and he was suddenly remembering the many times he had got into the warm bed beside Maria, and the tiny cold cross on her rosary touched his flesh on winter nights like a tittering little serpent, and how he withdrew quickly to an even colder part of the bed, and then he though of the bedroom, of the house that was not paid for, of the white wife endlessly waiting for passion, and he could not endure it, and straightway in his fury he plunged into deeper snow off the sidewalk, letting his anger fight it out with the snow. <em>Dio cane. Dio cane.</em> </p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste-Dark-8",

I fear im slowly slipping into a reading slump, as time has gone by my reading preferences have changed and I find myself looking for a little specific kind of book.<br/> I\u2019m looking for a romance with a playboy MMC who has a golden retriever vibe. He hasn\u2019t settled down yet because he knows he hasn\u2019t found the right FMC. This isnt a must but if able I\u2019d prefer both characters to be between 20\u201335, with no large age gap. I\u2019m not interested in one-night stands or heavy smut until they\u2019ve actually developed real feelings for each other. Please no \u201cteach me how to please a guy\u201d trope.</p> <p>I\u2019m okay with the MMC helping the FMC gain confidence or even helping her try to find a boyfriend, as long as it\u2019s not in a sexual way. I\u2019d also love an outgoing, sociable FMC who isn\u2019t overly na\u00efve.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RecommendationOne971\"> /u/RecommendationOne971 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",
