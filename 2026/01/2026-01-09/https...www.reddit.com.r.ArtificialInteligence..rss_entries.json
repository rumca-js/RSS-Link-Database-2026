So this is a primer for those who seek to understand what&#39;s going on and how it impacts the labour market, and how to react. Forget arguments about job loss, AI is not just a technological disruption; it is a systemic shock that will obliterate the current economic model by destroying the fundamental labour cycle. It will push society into a choice between a default of Techno Feudalism or a deliberate move to collective ownership of AI infrastructure.
