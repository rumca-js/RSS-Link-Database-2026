The drive is working well. I ran a complete S.M.A.R.T test on it, and everything was normal. I am currently rebuilding my storage pool to be RAID 5 (previously it was RAID 1). I don&#39;t need to use the warranty currently but just wanted to learn about it for later down the line if I ever do.</p> <p>Online, I&#39;ve read that Seagate can refuse to RMA your drive if it wasn&#39;t purchased from an authorized seller. From what I know, the drive should&#39;ve been purchased from Amazon, then returned and sold in a pallet to a liquidator from where I purchased it.</p> <p>I just wanted to ask about other people\u2019s experiences with the RMA process and how it works.
