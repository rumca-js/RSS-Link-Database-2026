This is partly because Greenland was one of those films in which Gerard Butler runs around looking as if he\u2019s desperately trying to hold in a whopper of a fart. However, releasing a film about Americans focusing all their effort on Greenland at this precise moment in time feels a little on the nose.</p><p>Also, and hopefully this isn\u2019t a spoiler, but it\u2019s weird to make Greenland 2 when the entire world was destroyed at the end of Greenland 1. In that film, you will remember, Butler and his family had to get to Greenland because the planet was about to be pummelled by meteors.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/jan/09/forget-big-ben-try-telfords-frog-clock-why-hollyw",
