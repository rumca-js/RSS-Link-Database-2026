        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nDevelopers at Pearl Abyss have dropped some details on the world of Crimson Desert. Via the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel, the devs had specified that the open world of Crimson Desert is about twice as large as Skyrim's, and larger as a whole than Red Dead Redemption 2. But they're aware that a large, empty world is no fun to play in, so the game will be 'incredibly interactive.' In other news, Larian Studios did an AMA on Reddit, and the company confirmed their upcoming Divinity RPG will have co-op. You will also be able to make meaningful changes to the story. And finally, fans of BioWare's Anthem are rallying to save the game ahead of server closures next week. The game was an infamous misfire for BioWare, and it never really found an audience large enough to support the game's live-service ambitions. But fans are working to get custom servers up, as the game will go offline permamently when the last official serviers go dark on Monday.",
