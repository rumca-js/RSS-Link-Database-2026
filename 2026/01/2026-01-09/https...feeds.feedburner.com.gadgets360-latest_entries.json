        "description": "Apple\u2019s iOS 26 has been downloaded and installed by only a small percentage of iPhone users, according to a report citing data from a web analytics service. The reason behind this is said to be the new Liquid Glass design, which was met with criticism for causing legibility issues due to the transparent UI elements. Moreover, iOS 26\u2019s adoption rate is significantly lower than the previous OS versions at the same time after their release, the report highlighted. After receiving flak from users, Apple started rolling out options to adjust the opacity of the UI elements, allowing users to make widgets and dialogue boxes less transparent.",
