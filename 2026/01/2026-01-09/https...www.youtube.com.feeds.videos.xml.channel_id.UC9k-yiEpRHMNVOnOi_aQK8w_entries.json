        "description": "In a medical mystery, someone was slowly poisoning 26-year-old mother Hannah Pettey. Pettey lost a lot of weight, ending up weighing just 84 pounds. She was finally hospitalized with acute respiratory failure and kept alive on a ventilator. She was then diagnosed with lead poisoning. CBS News correspondent Anne Marie Green is investigating the case for a \"48 Hours\" episode airing Saturday and spoke with Inside Edition's Alison Hall. Pettey made a full recovery, but the mystery remained: who poisoned her?",

The group works to keep bears out of places where they don't belong. They fired paintballs into the dirt in the crawl space and the bear scrambled out.",
