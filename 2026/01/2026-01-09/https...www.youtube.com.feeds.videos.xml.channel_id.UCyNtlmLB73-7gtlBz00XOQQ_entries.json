        "description": "Clickbait Title: Annihilation 2: Absolution (2027) Ending Explained\n\nI started work on this a year ago. The original script ended with a joke about touching grass, where I needed to go out into the snow and dig a little hole to find some grass to touch, and I even shot it as part of my \"get hyped about the project\" process. But then the Silkposting and CoD: Ghosts panels were approved for PAX East, so I had to pivot to working on those, and then I promised the final Ghosts video to PAX West as a live premiere, so Jarhead got kicked even further down the road, and then I got invited to a tour of Mr. Beast's studio which I absolutely couldn't turn down because I just could not figure out how they even got my name, so 2025 was a weird year.\n\nWritten by Dan Olson and Nathan Landel\nEdited by Dan Olson and Nathan Landel\nPerformed by Dan Olson\nExecutive Assistant Crystal Donovan\n\nSpecial Thanks to Big Joel and my Patrons\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nBlueSky: https://b",
