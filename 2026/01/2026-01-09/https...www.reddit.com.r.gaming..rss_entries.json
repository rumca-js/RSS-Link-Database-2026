I\u2019ve always been a PC gamer and have a huge steam library, but recently I picked up a PS5 and absolutely love it. I\u2019m going to be repurchasing some of my favorite games from PC just to play them again on PS5, some titles are cross progression which is nice but others are not. Does anybody else do this too? I\u2019m going to be replaying Kingdom Come 2, Borderlands 4, Ghosts of Tsushima, Forza Horizon 5 and Baldurs Gate 3. In a way it feels like a waste of money but to me the experience is different enough to justify it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/snoops1230\"> /u/snoops1230 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q8ddaa/multi_platform_gamers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q8ddaa/multi_platform_gamers/\">[comments]</a></span>",

If you know you want a PS5 but have been waiting, or a Switch 2 for a Mario or Zelda that will eventually come it may still be best to buy it now. Because it may be even more expensive when that does happen.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TableTravel98\"> /u/TableTravel98 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q7sncw/reality_check_if_youre_waiting_for_console_prices/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q7sncw/reality_check_if_youre_waiting_for_console_prices/\">[comments]</a></span>",
