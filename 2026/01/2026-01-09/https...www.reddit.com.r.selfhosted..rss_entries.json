Right now, Cloudflare DNS, Pi-hole, and Technitium are supported, but I&#39;m planning to add AdGuard Home as well.</p> <p>If you don&#39;t want to specify the IP and time to live, Docker DNS Exporter includes a default system, which allows you to set global defaults as well as ones scoped to specific name servers.</p> <pre><code>[record_defaults] ttl = 3600 # 1 Hour [name_servers.namese",
