        "description": "Maybe you are absolutely not ready for Highguard \u2013 not because it's set to blow your mind but because it's landing at a time where even the best ideas can suffer through hardship before turning things around. \n\nThe challenge is set, and Highguard has everything to play for. With a January 26th release date though, the countdown has already begun. If Wildlight Entertainment uses that short time to demonstrate a clear, confident identity for Highguard \u2013 to answer \u201cwhy we should care\u201d \u2013 then all the widespread resignation could still be flipped to belief.   \n\nBut we have seen absolutely nothing from the game since its showing last month. No deep dive, no teaser, no gameplay trailer..absolutely nothing, and that's a massive red flag. There are only a couple of weeks left before the game launches and time is clearly running out.\n\nBut that's not happening, is it?",
