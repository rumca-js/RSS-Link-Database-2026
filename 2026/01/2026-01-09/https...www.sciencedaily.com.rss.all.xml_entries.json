        "description": "Sugar-loving mouth bacteria create acids that damage teeth, but arginine can help fight back. In a clinical trial, arginine-treated dental plaque stayed less acidic, became structurally less harmful, and supported more beneficial bacteria. These changes made the biofilms less aggressive after sugar exposure. The results point to arginine as a promising, natural addition to cavity-prevention strategies.",

Common genetic variants can dramatically alter how fast this expansion happens, sometimes multiplying the pace by four. Researchers also identified specific DNA expansions linked to severe kidney and liver disease. The findings suggest that age-related DNA instability is far more common than previously realized.",

By clustering immune receptors that normally receive weak signals from tumors, these four-pronged antibodies push T cells into full attack mode. In early studies, they outperformed conventional antibodies at activating cancer-killing immune cells. The work opens the door to more effective immunotherapy treatments.",
