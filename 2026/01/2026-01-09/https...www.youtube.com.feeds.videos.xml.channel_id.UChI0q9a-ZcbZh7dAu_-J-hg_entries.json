        "description": "After a mega viral Reddit thread was posted on the first day of the new year, even major food delivery CEO's began responding, as an AI troll capitalized on hype and anger, to give people exactly what they wanted, with a carefully crafted narrative.\n\nWhile the anger against greedy corporate America is real, and justified, just because we WANT things to be true, and picture them as real, doesn't mean that they are. Its important to call out AI misinformation in all forms, not just when we disagree with it. \n\n\n\nTHE THREAD: https://web.archive.org/web/20260106045648/https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/\n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https",
