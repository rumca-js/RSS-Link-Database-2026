        "description": "Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine.\n \nAt least four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions.\n \nIt is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n \nIt's an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles).\n \nRussia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
