President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to pull out of more than 60 agencies, half of them part of the United Nations. Trump argues that being member of these organisations is contrary to his country's interests. The Secretary of State went as far as saying they're useless or wasteful. This move has prompted global outrage, with the UN saying its 'responsibility to deliver\u2019 will not waver. So, where does this all leave the multilateral global order?\n\nPresenter: James Bays\nGuests:\nAdolfo Franco -- Republican strategist and former adviser to US Senator John McCain\nAndrew Gilmour -- Former UN Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights\nMatthew Duss -- Executive VP of the Center for International Policy and a former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nF",
