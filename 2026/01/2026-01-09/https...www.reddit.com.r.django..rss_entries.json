        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m building a website which has a form where you login using email OTP. Basically the form initially has a user ID field and a submit button. When the submit button is clicked, the user ID is sent to the API of another website which sends an OTP to the user&#39;s email. At the same time, a new OTP field appears below the user ID field and the submit button changes to a login button. The user enters the correct OTP, and this is sent to the other website&#39;s API for validation, and he/she can log in.</p> <p>What is the simplest way of doing this? Like without using HTMX or Ajax, only HTML, JS, and Django. I mean, if HTMX and Ajax are necessary then I&#39;m willing to learn. </p> <p>I have only worked with the built in Signup and Login forms before, so this is all very new to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vismoh2010\"> /u/vismoh2010 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/djang",
