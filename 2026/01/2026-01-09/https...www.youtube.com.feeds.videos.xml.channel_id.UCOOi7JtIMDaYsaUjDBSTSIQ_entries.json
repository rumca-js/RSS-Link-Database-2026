That\u2019s before a spider, driving a little car, decides to go after them. A real race starts between both toys.\r\n \r\nWhen a National Geographic-style documentary blends with an irresistibly humorous Tex Avery cartoon\u2026 Minuscule combines 3D animation and live footage with no dialogue, offering an offbeat take on insects\u2019 daily lives and a fresh way to explore nature. With its universal charm, Minuscule captivates people of all ages around the world.\r\n \r\nMad fly | S03E08 | Minuscule\r\n \r\n\ud83e\udeb2 Minuscule: The Animated Series | Season 2 | Minuscule Official: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7eLsxQrsg-69_M01yj2OHYtCaM9N3ypx\r\n\r\n\u00a9 MMVI Futurikon - All rights reserved\r\n\r\n#flies #spider #race #toys #Minuscule #nature #insects #ladybugs #animatedseries",
