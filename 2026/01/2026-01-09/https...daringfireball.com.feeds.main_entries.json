When he saw the fuel\ntank was nearly empty, he stopped at a gas pump. What happened\nnext is something that\u2019s happened to all of us: He realized that\nhe\u2019d parked on the wrong side.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the rest of us, he wasn\u2019t infuriated. He was inspired. By\nthe time he pulled his car around, he was already thinking about\nhow to solve this everyday inconvenience that drives people\nabsolutely crazy. And because the gas pump wasn\u2019t covered by an\noverhead awning, he was also soaking wet. But when he got back to\nthe office, Moylan didn\u2019t even bother taking off his drenched coat\nwhen he started typing the first draft of a memo.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would like to propose a small addition,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin all\npassenger car and truck lines.\u201d The proposal he had in mind was a\nsymbol on the dashboard that woul",
