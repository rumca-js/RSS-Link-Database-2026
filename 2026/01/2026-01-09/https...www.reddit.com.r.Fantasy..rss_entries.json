The book takes its time on both the fast-paced action scenes, but really gets introspective with the characters. I also appreciated how serious Kaigen was.

For example, the first scene in Robin Hobb&#39;s Assassin&#39;s Quest is keeping the plot suspended for long, but it (and it taking a long time) is an integral part of the story, and of character development and insight for the protagonist. The books wouldn&#39;t be the same without that part. </p> <p>Similarly I also prefer extensive environment/item, technical action descriptions.
