        "description": "This tiny device can navigate using quantum physics rather than GPS!\n\nNormally, a pilot needs four satellites to figure out its location\u2026\nBut this device uses atoms that act like compass needles sensitive to earth\u2019s magnetic field, which is different everywhere!\n\nSo it can record the magnetic \u201cfingerprint\u201d anywhere, no satellites needed!\n\nFor more optimistic science and tech stories, subscribe!\n\n#science #magnet #GPS #quantum #technology #shorts",
