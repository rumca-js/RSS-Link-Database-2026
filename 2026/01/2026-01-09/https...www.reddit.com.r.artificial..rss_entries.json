This is still a relatively underexplored concept however the recent surge of research suggests why it is gaining traction.</p> <p>For example, Marble demonstrates how multimodal models that encode a <em>sense of the world</em> can achieve far greater efficiency and reasoning capability than LLMs, which are inherently limited to predicting the next token. Genie illustrates how 3D interactive environments can be learned and simulated to support agent planning and reasoning. Other recent work includes SCOPE, which leverages world modelling to match frontier LLM performance (GPT-4-level) with far smaller models (millions versus trillions of parameters), and HunyuanWorld, which scored ~77 on the WorldScore benchmark. There are also new models being developed that push the boundaries of world modellin",
