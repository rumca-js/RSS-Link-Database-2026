Since then, relationships have taught me some hard truths about love. You cannot wear masks forever. You cannot be fully dependent on someone else. Compromise has to go both ways, and boundaries matter. I am done accepting toxic dynamics.</p> <p>I lived abroad for four years, and that period changed me a lot.

I normally listen to true crime and don\u2019t mind the gruesome stuff. I am normally listening to podcast. Sometimes these stories can be heavy so I would like to explore the fiction side. I have so far read Never Lie by Freida McFadden. I loved it. It was thrilling and suspenseful, interesting and easy to follow. I\u2019ve also read the Housemaid and have enjoyed that as well. I started The Butcher &amp; Blackbird and I\u2019m not gonna to lie it has not been my favorite so far. It\u2019s a little too fantasy and unrealistic. I think I like stories that seem more realistic. I think topics I would like to explore are infidelity, murder, kidnapping, investigations, heroes, revenge , romance, and spicy romance.

I do like romance, the kind like Haunting Adeline, but I think it\u2019s better for me to not read romance lol. I really like psychological horror. I like being able to inject myself into the main character or others. I like darker, taboo things. Something very gripping and vivid. I\u2019d love to get into classic literature and stuck on either 1. East of Eden or 2. The Picture of Dorian Gray. So I guess I\u2019m looking for a book that is very immersive and gripping centering psychological horror or something.

Not in a smutty kind of a way, but a lot of those YA books like love, Simon etc. never interested me even when I was a teenager. I\u2019m a 23 year old lesbian living with my partner and I still find it hard to be fully accepting of myself, and worry what people think of us a lot. I want to expose myself to as much LGBT literature as I can as I think it will help me to work through it through a less self-centred lens. I adored the book Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe, so it can be books that are technically for teenagers, but really what I\u2019m looking for is something with some substance and grit and realism.
