        "description": "Today Quincy Larson interviews Zubin Pratap, a software engineer and manager from Melbourne, Australia. After nearly two decades working as a corporate lawyer, he taught himself programming using freeCodeCamp.org. Within two years, he landed a job as a software engineer at Google.\n\nWe talk about:\n- How tools are making programming easier, but other parts of being a developer harder\n- How 2009 - 2022 was NOT a normal job market and how devs are adapting\n- \"The purpose of communication is to be understood\" and other lessons Zubin's learned over the years\n\nSupport for this podcast is provided by a grant from AlgoMonster. AlgoMonster is a platform that teaches data structure and algorithm patterns in a structured sequence, so you can approach technical interview questions more systematically. Their curriculum covers patterns like sliding window, two-pointers, graph search, and dynamic programming, helping you learn each pattern once and apply it to solve many problems.
