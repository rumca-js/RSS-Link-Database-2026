Not the smartest approach, I know.</p> <p>How do you quickly check if an idea is worth your time before diving in?</p> <p>Do you make a simple landing page and collect emails? Ask people directly in forums or DMs? Try to pre-sell it first? Or just build it and see what happens?</p> <p>I get why validation matters but setting up landing pages feels like extra work and selling without having a product yet.
