        "description": "We all make mistakes, but what if our most shameful moments are actually priceless gifts? In this powerful TEDx talk, backed by psychological research, Theresa M. Ward shares how a literal crash landing \u2014 and a series of emotional ones \u2014 taught her that our worst mistakes aren\u2019t failures to hide, but truths to own. By confronting her missteps, from broken bones to broken trust, she discovered that our \"villainous\" moments aren't weakness, they're the birthplace of wise alignment, deep connection, and heroic growth. \n\nTheresa M. Ward spent over a decade in the financial technology space before starting her own consultancy in 2017. She now serves as a team effectiveness coach, helping professionals in any industry thrive with a sense of meaningful momentum at work. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia with her fianc\u00e9, where she loves to hike, practice yoga, and curl up with her senior dogs and a good book. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently ",

Ao lembrar como a leitura expande casas pequenas, atravessa limites e autoriza sonhos, esta fala mostra que livros n\u00e3o s\u00e3o somente hist\u00f3rias: s\u00e3o chaves que abrem possibilidades, janelas para outros futuros e espelhos que ajudam a nomear emo\u00e7\u00f5es. Quando uma crian\u00e7a se reconhece em um personagem, ela entende que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 sozinha \u2014 e esse encontro fortalece a autoestima, a imagina\u00e7\u00e3o e a capacidade de aprender. Em um pa\u00eds onde muitas inf\u00e2ncias ainda crescem sem acesso a livros, colocar um exemplar nas m\u00e3os de uma crian\u00e7a \u00e9 oferecer futuro: esperan\u00e7a concreta, repert\u00f3rio e a chance de transformar a pr\u00f3pria vida \u2014 e, com ela, a sociedade.

        "description": "O consumo n\u00e3o serve apenas para atender necessidades: ele comunica identidade, marca pertencimento e, muitas vezes, sustenta uma performance social. Ao mostrar como cultura, redes sociais e vieses do c\u00e9rebro influenciam decis\u00f5es financeiras, esta fala desmonta a ideia de que renda alta garante tranquilidade. A chave n\u00e3o est\u00e1 s\u00f3 em \u201cter mais\u201d, mas em mudar o contexto: reduzir a disponibilidade, dar novos significados ao dinheiro e criar limites que n\u00e3o dependam somente de for\u00e7a de vontade.

Un atto che trasforma chi cammina e, allo stesso tempo, lascia qualcosa a ci\u00f2 che viene attraversato.\nUn intervento che invita a riconsiderare il nostro modo di attraversare il mondo, riscoprendo nel cammino un gesto semplice ma profondamente umano.\n Siracusana, classe 1989, Fede Miceli cammina per abitare il mondo, non per attraversarlo in fretta.

In questo talk intenso e autentico, Paolo Amico parte da una domanda semplice solo in apparenza per accompagnarci in un viaggio fatto di scelte, deviazioni, cadute e nuove direzioni.\nPaolo esplora il momento in cui ci si rende conto che la strada su cui stiamo camminando non \u00e8 stata scelta da noi. \u00c8 proprio l\u00ec, in quello spazio di dubbio e incertezza, che nasce la possibilit\u00e0 di fermarsi, guardarsi dentro e iniziare a tracciare un percorso nuovo, unico, imperfetto ma profondamente nostro.\nIl talk affronta temi universali come il rapporto con le aspettative degli altri, la paura di sbagliare, il valore del fallimento e il coraggio di cambiare rotta. Disegnare la propria strada non significa avere tutto sotto controllo, ma accettare l\u2019idea che il cammino si costruisce passo dopo passo, anche quando non si vede ancora la meta.\nUn inter",

In addition, he highlights the impact of policy on our daily decisions and lifestyles, explains why global poverty has been reduced over the last thirty years, and links the current increase in CO2 levels to the future direction of the planet.\n\nFurthermore, Vivek emphasizes that people must be aware of the transformative possibilities available to them to maximize their chances of success. He points out that while transformation can occur by chance, it is most likely to occur through the exercise of individual choice. He uses the story of 'A Tale of Two Cities', the change from a bipolar to a multipolar world, and the fundamental design vs. destiny theme to elaborate on why people should be aware of transformative possibilities around them.\n\nVivek encourages students to look beyond the class",
