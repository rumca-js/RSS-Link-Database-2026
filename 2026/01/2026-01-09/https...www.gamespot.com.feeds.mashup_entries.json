After all, they're very affordable, and their pocket-friendly design makes them easy to carry around. But recently, we've also seen various manga publishers offer deluxe editions of some of the biggest manga properties around. Typically, these deluxe editions follow a similar format of reprinting each manga on an oversized page format and binding them inside a faux leather hardcover package alongside a selection of exclusive extra content.</p><p>So far, only a handful of manga series have been adapted into this format by the likes of Kodansha and Dark Horse Comics, but we've rounded up those that are available in the list below. We'll also update this list as more manga titles get the deluxe edition treatment.</p></p><br/>     <p><h2>Berserk Deluxe Edition</h2><img src=\"https://www.game",
