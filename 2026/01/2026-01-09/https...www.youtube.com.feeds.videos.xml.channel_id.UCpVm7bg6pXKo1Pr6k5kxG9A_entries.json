        "description": "Who was King Tut? Delve into ancient, Egyptian history in this MEGA episode of Tut's Treasures: Hidden Secrets. Featuring three full episodes: \n\nTales from the Tomb\nOf all the 5,398 treasures from the tomb of Tutankhamun now being assembled and forensically investigated at the Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, it\u2019s the ones that paint a picture of Tutankhamun\u2019s family that are the most unsettling.\n\nTreasures Rediscovered\nMany have never been seen before but together they shed new light on the short, eventful life of the so-called \u2018Boy King\u2019 and are now helping experts realise the sheer scale of Tutankhamun\u2019s influence in the ancient world.\n\nGolden Mask\nKing Tut\u2019s incredible death mask \u2013 24lbs of pure gold - has always been the subject of debate with many scholars believing its damaged nameplate, known as a cartouche, and different colours of gold meant it was never made specifically for him. It was more likely made for his female ancestor, Nefertiti. \n\nTut's Treasures: Hidden Secrets | ",
