I have a Pi 3 running the SANE software, along with a CanoScan LIDE 120. According to <a href=\"http://sane-project.org\">sane-project.org</a>, that scanner is compatible with SANE. But when I plug it into the Pi&#39;s USB port, no scanner is detected at all. I&#39;ve tried a number of online troubleshooting angles, but nothing seems to work.</p> <p>For example, lsusb doesn&#39;t see the scanner. And running scanimage -L only gives me an input/output error.</p> <p>The only thing I can come up with at this point is that maybe I need to put a powered USB hub between the scanner and the Pi? Before I go buy one, I thought I&#39;d see if anyone had had any luck with SANE on the Pi or had any suggestions for further troubleshooting.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/barrylyga\"> /u/barrylyga </a> <br/> <span><a hr",
