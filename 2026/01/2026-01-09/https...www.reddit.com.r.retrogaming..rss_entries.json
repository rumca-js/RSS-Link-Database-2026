This wasn&#39;t really a consideration until a handful of Super Nintendo games started featuring Dolby Surround Sound support. Jurassic Park, Super Turrican and a number of others. Also, supposedly there&#39;s a bunch of SNES games that feature support but don&#39;t advertise that they do. Starfox and the DKC trilogy supposedly do.</p> <p>When you get to the Sony PlayStation, seems like there&#39;s a lot more games that feature Dolby Surround Sound. One game that really jumps out to me is Oddworld: Abe&#39;s Odyssey. I think the surround sound effects for the machine gun noises are absolutely spectacular. Or at least, the first time I experienced it, back in 1996, I was totally blown away by it.

I didn&#39;t get a lot of free time last weekend and this week, so I didn&#39;t get much progress outside getting another Piece of Heart that I missed. At this point, I think I&#39;m ready to take on the 7th dungeon. I&#39;ve got the Boomerang, the L-2 Sword, the colored tunics, and 11 out of the 12 Heart Pieces so I think the rest of the game is going to be straightforward. Beating this will all depend on how much free time I get.</p> <p>What about you guys?
