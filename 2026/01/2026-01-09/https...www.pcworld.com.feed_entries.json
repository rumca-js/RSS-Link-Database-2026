The battery, keyboard, USB ports, fans, and speakers can be easily removed and replaced. Hurrah!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s a catch.

I asked the representatives on the floor\u00a0where users will be able to purchase replacement parts and how much they might cost.

Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not be an option. That\u2019s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with much needed security for no cost at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best VPNs</a>, I understand that sometimes ",

With a camera at the front door and an app on their phone, they jump to the conclusion that they\u2019ll capture faces on the sidewalk, license plates at the curb, and anybody cutting across the lawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most doorbell cameras deliver far more modest real-world performances. They have a tight field of view that sees what\u2019s directly in front of their lens; they\u2019re built to frame a visitor\u2019s face standing in front of the door, not the entire space <em>around</em> the door. That leaves blind spots that can surprise new owners: areas right at the threshold, where packages disappear from view; blurry depictions of passersby on the sidewalk or people walking up the driveway, because they\u2019re outside the camera\u2019s field of view; and side-to-side movement clos",

Often, companies that take the top spot mellow out and focus on tried-andtrue products, but not so with Lenovo. As it finds more success, Lenovo seems to lean more and more into the experimental\u2014<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2890690/laptop-designs-are-getting-weird-again-and-im-all-for-it.html\">a trend I\u2019m excited about and fully on board with</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At CES 2026, Lenovo brought a number of laptops (and a desktop) with unusual features. The company added new spins on its rollable OLED laptop (still the only such laptop to hit store shelves), introduced a laptop that opens with a knock, and debuted an all-in-one desktop with a display that\u2019s nearly square, among other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the w",

That same panel technology will also bring a wave of new 34-inch ultrawide OLED monitors with a 360Hz refresh rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not all from Samsung. The company also introduced the world\u2019s first 1,000Hz monitor (actually up to 1,040Hz). Though it\u2019s regrettably not an OLED display, and can only achieve that at 720p resolution, it\u2019s a sign of where monitors are going. Refresh rates are up across the board, and 120Hz is starting to look like the new 60Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LG also went hard, though it put an emphasis on resolution with several new 5K2K ultrawide monitors.
