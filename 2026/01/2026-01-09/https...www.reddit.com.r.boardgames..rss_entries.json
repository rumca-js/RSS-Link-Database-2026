I love big board games, but haven&#39;t played too many. Never played anything as big as these though. Probably the most &quot;complex&quot; was Betrayal at House on the Hill, and it&#39;s one of my favorites. </p> <p>My question is, which of these would be good to pick up if just getting one (for now)? I&#39;ve seen outstanding reviews for all three titles. </p> <p>I&#39;ve also been drawn to Aeon Trespass: Odyssey but that may be too much as a first buy into these types of games with how complex people make it out to be. </p> <p>Anyways, would love to hear all of your thoughts!

There are hand marker cards so you know which hand is which (of limited value?) But what we&#39;ve found difficult is counting the number of turns. Has that been ten or eight? Has the round finished now or not? We could introduce some mechanism for tracking progress through a round. So far we&#39;ve simply ended a round by consensus - yeah it&#39;s probably been ten turns and there&#39;s not much more we can do with these cards, let&#39;s call it. Anyone found a convenient way to do this or concluded that ending a round after ten turns exactly is/isn&#39;t critical? We&#39;re generally a two-player game, so the hand marker cards are only really useful for modulo 2 counting.</p> <p>On another &quot;is it critical&quot; question, after playing through, we realized we&#39;d missed the rule whereby you can&#39;t partially fund habitat or poaching pro",

But after playing it 3 times (twice with 5 and once with 4) i&#39;m afraid i dont like it at all. And it makes me very confused as to why this game is so loved. I want to love it, but there are a lot of things that bug me about it and because i cant seem to find anyone else that feels the same way, i felt compelled to post it here.. A few reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Teleporting everywhere feels so weird, almost no one moves normally because it almost never feels worth it, so it just becomes a teleporting fest, i miss the feeling of an approaching army. And the teleporting doesnt feel thematic, it feels like a sci-fi game. And on top of that, nobody is ever going for eachothers cities because staying on the obelisk spots is way better.</li> <li>The tech tiles, my god, the tech tiles. They are cool and all, and it",

If I run the game once with just the base game and then later pick up expansions, am I going to be repeating a lot of situations with just a sprinkling of new content? If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d probably just add those from the jump. Or, if it&#39;s reasonable to dip the toes in and then play again with more content and still feel pretty fresh, maybe I would only try the base game first.</p> <p>Maybe a more",
