I\u2019m curious how you personally discover open-source projects that are actually useful or interesting.</p> <p>I\u2019m not from a technical background, but lately I\u2019ve been exploring a lot of open source especially tools that help non-experts improve productivity or are simply fun to play with. I also share discoveries with a small group of friends in a similar situation.</p> <p>Would love to learn your discovery workflow:</p> <ul> <li>Are you mostly task-driven? How do you search?</li> <li>Any newsletters / weekly digests / top-repo lists / related repos / communities you follow consistently?</li> <li>Any creators / maintainers / accounts that regularly share great open-source projects?</li> <li>What is your personal stack? </li> </ul> <p>Also feel free to share your own project if it\u2019s interesting enough and non-expert friendly lol.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

NestJS solves this with structure, but it introduces &quot;Module Hell&quot;, constant management of imports: [], exports: [], and providers: [] arrays just to get basic Dependency Injection (DI) working.</p> <p>The Solution: I built Rikta to provide a &quot;middle ground.&quot; It offers the power of decorators and a robust DI system, but with Zero-Config Autowiring. You decorate a class, and it just works.</p> <h1>\ud83d\ude80 Key Features:</h1> <ul> <li>Zero-Config DI: No manual module registration. It uses experimental decorators and reflect-metadata to handle dependencies automatically.</li> <li>Powered by Fastify: It",

So, I built something a bit different.</p> <p>The &quot;big idea&quot; is that I wanted to keep everything simple - no databases, no logins, just plain files on my computer. I wanted to own my data and be able to edit it whenever I want without fighting a UI.</p> <p>But the coolest part? I designed it to work perfectly with AI. If you&#39;re using an AI editor like Cursor, Antigravity or VS Code with an agent, you literally just open the project folder. That&#39;s it. No setup. The AI reads the instructions I&#39;ve baked in and basically becomes your personal accountant.</p> <p>You can just say &quot;Hey, create an invoice for John for that consulting work&quot; and it goes off, finds the info, and generates a professional PDF for you.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the lowdown:</p> <ul> <li><strong>No D",

It started from a simple annoyance: lots of libraries are way too difficult to use for colored logging. I wanted something even me dumbo can use, and really gets out all of my console output.</p> <h3>What Colorino does</h3> <p>Colorino is a tiny logger that wraps the usual console methods (like <code>info</code>, <code>warn</code>, <code>error</code>) and adds color, levels, and theming on top. In Node it uses ANSI colors; in the browser it uses CSS, but you write the same code in both places.</p> <p>On top of that, it supports auto theme detection, so you can just use even with zero-config to get a pleasurable console output.</p> <p>Graceful degradarion in colorino is used to come as close as possible to the colors you defined.</p> <h3>Basic usage</h3> <p>```ts import",

It all depends on users buying paid UI templates, which they sell for lifetime access on single purchase instead of recurring subscriptions. Recurring subscriptions may not be possible the way tailwind works and what it offers but still. To add more, I suppose no one would be buying those templates when LLM can create same UI for free.
