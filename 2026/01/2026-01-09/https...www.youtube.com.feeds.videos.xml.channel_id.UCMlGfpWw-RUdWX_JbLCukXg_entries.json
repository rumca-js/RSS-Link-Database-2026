Ranges offer lazy, on-demand computation that improves I/O efficiency and composability. Parallel algorithms, on the other hand, harness multitasking to speed up compute-heavy workloads. \n \nAt first glance, these two features seem like a perfect match: lazy evaluation to minimize I/O overhead, and parallelism to maximize throughput. However, in practice, they don\u2019t play well together. Many range operations\u2014especially those over non-random-access sources\u2014are inherently sequential due to their lazy pull-based, one-element-at-a-time nature. \n \nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore a modern library technique that unlocks the synergy between lazy ranges and parallelism. You\u2019ll see how to build lazy, composable range pipelines",
