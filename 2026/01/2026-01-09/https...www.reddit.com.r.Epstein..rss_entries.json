        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Epstein recruited young girls who then recruited other girls, so many of the victims are probably also the co-conspirators. Virginia Guifre expressed guilt in the Netflix Epstein documentary about her role ruining the innocence of other girls. So her name is redacted because she&#39;s a victim. </p> <p>But Epstein didn&#39;t just do sex crimes, he had his have in all types of crime. Imagine there&#39;s a sex obsessed real estate mogul who has a history of rape and fraud. That&#39;s the type of client that Epstein can both profit from and theoretically blackmail. But being blackmailed makes them technically an Epstein victim, so the DOJ can use that logic to black out their names. </p> <p>It is pretty well recognized that the DOJ allowed Epstein off easy for some pretty heinous stuff and pretty telling that there have been no other real arrests less Epstein and Maxwell. The public is demanding accountability for this and they released only less than 5%",
