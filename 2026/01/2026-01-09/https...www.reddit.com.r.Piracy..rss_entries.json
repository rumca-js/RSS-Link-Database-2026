Mul something and the likes.</p> <p>Is that correct so far?</p> <p>What I did not find is, if there is someth like a substitute for Piratebay? Like an all purpose site? Or if not, where the place for series and movies is. I think streaming plattforms deserve a bit of thinking time about what good service is.</p> <p>If I (debatable stance) dont need a vpn besides torrenting did anyone else use like a week of paid vpn to go crazy and then quit?</p> <p>Thank you in advance and arrr or someth like that!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Markuska90\"> /u/Markuska90 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1q87fpx/starter_questions_where_to_go/\">[link]</a></span> &",

Getting everything working together was a bigger pain than I expected.</p> <p>The DLC files were especially annoying to track down - most of what I found was either corrupted, encrypted, or had region mismatch issues causing infinite loading. After way too much troubleshooting (and one full reinstall), I finally got a complete USA setup working properly.</p> <p>The result is honestly way better than playing on actual 3DS hardware. Runs smooth, looks great, and I&#39;ve got all the content.</p> <p>Since I went through all that hassle, I put together a complete backup package for myself in case I ever want to do this again.
