Goonies) are definitely not G by todays standards with the violence and swearing, and some movies today that are rated PG-13 I think are fine for my kids (they watched the first Avengers movie with their grandparents and enjoyed it). I look at some things on common sense media for a general idea but I feel like that site is a bit more conservative than I am</p> <p>The issue I have is that I&#39;m personally exhausted on the modern animated movies from Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks and I&#39;m looking for some deeper cut recommendations, could be modern or classics.

I love that movie and it\u2019s become a holiday classic, and while it does a great job of being a holiday movie I realized it\u2019s also such a New Yorker movie, as well. I love all the different scenes in the famous landmarks like Central Park, Lincoln Center and so on, and the characters and writing have a real New York feeling, at least to someone like me that hasn\u2019t lived in the city. </p> <p>What other movies do something like this? Where the themes or genre don\u2019t need to rely on the setting but the movie still does a great job of capturing the setting.

You could see all the time in the facial expressions and body language of Ripley how she felt under pressure and in the technical effects with light and vapour and sound. At the final scene where the heroine goes in cryosleep we can witness a powerful image of coming to peace. Even though I knew very well how it ends i still got the goosebumps during all the scenes from the final act. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSoilSimp\"> /u/TheSoilSimp </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1q8ax77/alien_1979/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1q8ax77/alien_1979/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Interestingly enough, the portion during which Bella works at the brothel is much shorter and less explicit in the novel. Her main takeaway from the experience isn\u2019t necessarily one of empowerment (e.g. an idea intimated in the film by lines such as \u201cWe are our own means of production\u201d - Bella). If memory serves me correctly, Bella is still naive and doesn\u2019t fully grasp her situation\u2014but she is horrified by the dreadful conditions that she and the other girls work under. She is upset by the invasive and dehumanizing gynecological exams that the on-call doctor subjects the girls to in order to check for STDs and pregnancy.

The film has amazing puppets done by Jim Henson\u2019s creature shop to which Jim Henson directed the film. The set designs are amazing and very well done. Jennifer Connelly is great in the film and what could you say about David Bowie\u2019s performance as the Goblin King Jareth, Bowie pulled off a great performance as the villain.
