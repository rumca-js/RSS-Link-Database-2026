In this lightning talk from ACCU Conference 2025, Egor Suvorov exposes the hidden dangers of comparing float and int types in C++ and how these comparisons can trigger undefined behavior in standard algorithms like `std::sort`.\n\nWhen sorting heterogeneous data, implicit type conversion from `long long` to `double` can lead to rounding errors, comparator contradictions, and ultimately cause your program to crash, freeze, or return incorrect results. This talk demonstrates exactly how C++ float rounding, numeric limits, and NaN values can introduce subtle, hard-to-detect bugs\u2014especially when comparing floats and ints directly",
