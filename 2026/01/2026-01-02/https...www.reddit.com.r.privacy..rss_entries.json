If you go and read up on Personas website, it is making lots of data \u201csafety claims\u201d but nothing about selling or sharing your data. Persona claims to have worked with OpenAI as if that makes their service safer. </p> <p>I had to go through the original merchant to file a claim with Route as I wasn\u2019t giving them my data. Route ended up trying to keep the fee I paid for their \u201cservices.\u201d </p> <p>What do you think of this? Should Route be the new normal?
