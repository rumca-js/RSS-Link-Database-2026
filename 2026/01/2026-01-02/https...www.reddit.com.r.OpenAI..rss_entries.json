I really love chatgpt but this is becoming a dealbreaker because now I have to wait alot of time. yesterday it took each prompt 15 min - 30 min each time i have to manually click wait and not kill for the browser during popup. interestingly this is not happening in the phone app, but desktop app and browser is really bad.<br/> And I use a high end laptop for coding , Unity etc so thats not the issue as well. and I tried different browsers apart from chrome, still same result. Please do share if you have faced this and any solution to resolve this.

When I started my bachelor&#39;s in 2021, there was basically no AI to ask for help, especially for coding tasks. I remmber having to fight with the compiler just to get enough points to be admitted to the exams.</p> <p>When ChatGPT first came out (3.5), I tried using it for things like database schemas, but honestly, it wasn&#39;t that helpful for me back then. But 2025 feels completely different. I&#39;ve talked to students in lower semesters, and they say it&#39;s a total game-changer. I&#39;ve even heard that the dedicated tutoring rooms on campus are alsmost empty now because everyone uses AI.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently writing my thesis on this topic. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Is AI a &quot;tutor&quot; for you, or do you feel it creates a dependency? Also if you have 5 minutes, I would really appreciate it if you could fill out my survey<",

Lately, however, working with Cursor, I&#39;ve come to realize my focus has shifted. It&#39;s less about prompt-crafting, it&#39;s more about controlling the agent orchestration.</p> <p>If you tell Cursor, say 1, it will literally just say 1. If you tell it to write feature x, it will write feature x. If you tell it to write it using this mcp, for example, or that specific library (tailwind, shadcn, etc), it will do it. So yes, being specific where it matters still counts for A LOT.</p> <p>However there is something deeper and more fundamental than specificity. There&#39;s context fundamentals.
