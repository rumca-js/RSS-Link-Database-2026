Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database\u2014GraphQLite adds Cypher&#39;s expressive pattern matching on top.</p> <p>You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths.

Originally called <code>Limestone</code>, the project had my implementations of the Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, Waterman-Smith-Beyer, and Wagner-Fischer alignment algorithms.</p> <p>Over the past few years, over 20 new algorithms have been added including the Ratcliff-Obershelp algorithm and the Feng-Doolittle multiple sequence alignment algorithm. The alignment algorithms that allow for custom scoring, such as Needleman-Wunsch and Gotoh, also support scoring matrices which can be imported from <a href=\"https://github.com/lignum-vitae/biobase\">Biobase</a>.</p> <p>Biobase is primarily a personal project to make certain tasks simpler and easier for me and Goombay is the culmination of all the knowledge I&#39;ve gained over the past year or so, but hopefully both packages can also be useful to others",

Simple and easy to integrate, but may produce minor color artifacts. - PR <a href=\"https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/pull/177\">#177</a>: Uses CIELAB color space for perceptual accuracy. Produces better visual results but is more complex and potentially slower.</p> <p>As a maintainer, I want to ensure we end up with a single, high-quality implementation and make that decision as fairly and kindly as possible. I\u2019ve created a GitHub discussion to encourage the contributors to collaborate and combine the best aspects of both PRs, rather than competing against each ",
