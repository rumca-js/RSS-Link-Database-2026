It was about a red haired girl who sacrifices herself in a battle and I believe the show was about a blue haired girl dealing with that loss. The red haired girls death scene had like explosions in the background while she was kinda gliding across the screen. Not sure if the battle had like mechs or tanks. I think they were involved in like a military or something.</p> <p>Sorry if everything is very vague.</p> <p>Edit: just watched the first episode of symphogear and it\u2019s probably symphogear.

See the comments for previous installments in the series.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Catch Me At The Ballpark</strong> is an unconventional series. Ostensibly a sports show about baseball, the focus is not solely on the players but about all sorts of people you might meet while visiting a ballpark. Every episode is split into three segments with individual stories of food vendors, security guards, mascots, or simply visitors. Though the baseball team also becomes a focus, particularly later in the anime, our main character is Ruriko, a roaming beer vendor girl in her first season with the team.</p> <p>The tone of the show is mostly comedic and light-hearted.

The only other studio that can constantly compete in that regard is Trigger. This is a fantastic anime. It&#39;s about a teenage boy named Sanda Kuzuhise. Episode 1 does an excellent job immediately bombarding us with intrigue and excitement as he&#39;s running for his life through a classroom, trying to avoid getting stabbed by a female classmate of his named Shiori Fuyumura. While he in his simplistic mind assumes that it&#39;s because she&#39;s in love with him, she later reveals that she wants his help with something and this is the only way she knows how to get his attention because she&#39;s also an idiot. I love that they&#39;re both quite stupid in their own unique ways, and in somewhat realistic ways but with an anime flare. Apparently Shiori best friend went missing, named Ichie Ono, everyone thinks she&#39;s dead",
