Out of all MacOS users 36% more use MacBook Pro than in November and 24% more use MacBook Air? Again, also these numbers add up to way more than 100%</p> <p>I guess some bug happened in the new survey so I would take all of these numbers with a grain of salt.

The thing how it behaves is: PC APPEARS to be in sleep mode, but it is not, since wattmeter is still showing 20W which is same as when PC is simply running in idle. I have tried various &quot;systemctl suspend&quot; commands, none works. it is like 50 50 or 33 66 chance that it won&#39;t work. I do not want windows, that is trash spyware, but I am not sure, if this is linux or lenovo issue. In BIOS, lenovo is ultra limited, and I was unable to find any useful thing to enable or disable.
