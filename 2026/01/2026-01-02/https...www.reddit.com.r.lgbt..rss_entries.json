It was weird at first, the first person I came out with was my long distance bestfriend, who is a lesbian too and I\u2019m still friend with, but almost no one knows that I like girls, and I\u2019m scared to come out but at the same time I want to, because when someone shows me a good looking boy I have to pretend that I like him, and I\u2019m tired of lying. At the same time, I don\u2019t know if they support LGBTQ+ or if my girl friends wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with me anymore. I have one girl friend that\u2019s strictly religious, she\u2019s the best person I have in my class but I\u2019m scared to come out to her because maybe she doesn\u2019t accept me or just doesn\u2019t wanna be friends with me anymore. Other classmates make fun of the LGBTQ+ community all the time, using \u201cgay\u201d as an insult, and every time I feel bad about it. I haven\u2019t come out to neither of my parents because, even if they\u2019re not homophobic, I know they would",

I was in the front yard sipping on some wine and called my Mom to come outside.</p> <p>I told her that I needed to let her know something, and to please not get angry. She really wanted to know and told me to trust in her. I told her that I\u2019m gay just like that. She told me that that\u2019s what she had figured I wanted to tell her.</p> <p>I asked her if she was mad at me, but she said not at all! She only asked when I had known this (which was a couple years ago). She gave me a hug and told me there wasn\u2019t any problem with it. We then went to the cinema which we had planned to do.</p> <p>I still gotta tell my Dad eventually , who I feel might not handle it as well as my Mother. I just feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my chest, like I can finally start being myself a bit more.
