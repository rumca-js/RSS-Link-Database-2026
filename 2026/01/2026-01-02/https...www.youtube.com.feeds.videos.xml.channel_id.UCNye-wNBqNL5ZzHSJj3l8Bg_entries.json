The rift between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is now out in the open, as former allies clash over territory, ports and military bases.\nThis escalation intersects with broader regional shifts after the Gaza war, a struggle over maritime corridors in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb, and the role of the Houthis (Ansarallah) as a significant military and political force observing the scene and preparing to impose their own terms. Major questions are being raised about the future of Yemen\u2019s unity, the project of a southern state, the limits of Saudi and Emirati influence, and whether the country is being dragged into another long war with no clear diplomatic horizon.\n\nS",

None of the dates or references have been changed.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is operating in an unprecedented way during US President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. The agency has existed for over 20 years, but now operates as a masked force. Imposters posing as agents have committed crimes such as kidnapping and sexual assault. The FBI has urged ICE officers to unmask and identify themselves. How did the agency get here?\n\nIn this episode:\n\n- Hannah Allam, Reporter, ProPublica\n\nEpisode credits:\n\nThis episode was produced by Haleema Shah, Sar\u00ed el-Khalili and Diana Ferrero, with Melanie Marich, Farhan Rafid, Fatima Shafiq, Tamara Khandaker, and our guest host, Natasha Del Toro. It was edited by Noor Wazwaz and Kylene Kiang.\n\nOur sound designer is Alex Roldan. Our video editors are Hisham Abu Salah and Mohannad al-Melhem. Alexandra Locke is The Take\u2019s executive prod",
