Starting with foundational concepts and CPOs, we'll design mathematical abstractions that enable precise compile-time requirements with helpful diagnostics and clear error messages. \n \n Through a practical vector framework implementation, we'll explore patterns essential for high-performance scientific computing applications, including interpolation and iterative methods for linear and nonlinear systems. Attendees will learn how CPOs with intelligent fallbacks parallel the familiar base-class/override structure of OOP, providing similar code reuse and customization opportunities without inheritance entanglements, while",
