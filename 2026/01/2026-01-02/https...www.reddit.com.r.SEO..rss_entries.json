Clicks and page ranking are the most important metrics at the moment.</p> <p>I have been tending to use Search Console to look at individual pages, but im wondering if there is a better way for me to automate of bulk track performance as sifting through search console can take quite a lot of time, and this will only increase as I create more pages. I have used Semrush in the past, but position and traffic data seems increasingly out of date or divorced from reality.</p> <p>For context, I write articles and guides for the site and have been tasked with tracking performance of these pages. I know some bits and bobs about SEO, but im not an expert.</p> <p>I hope im giving enough information! Advice about different ways to gather data and build reports would be appreciated - as well as signposts to ",

Not a big crash, just slow decay. Pages dropping out, crawl rate going down, Search Console getting quieter. Now all three are basically in the same state where only the homepage is indexed and everything else just refuses to come back.</p> <p>What\u2019s extra weird is that in GSC I can literally see URLs as \u201ccrawled currently not indexed\u201d.
