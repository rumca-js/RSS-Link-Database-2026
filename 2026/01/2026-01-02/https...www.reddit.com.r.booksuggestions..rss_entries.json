I could use some recommendations for genres for people who enjoy sci-fi fantasy but is not sci-fi fantasy. I have thought about horror, mystery, adventures etc but don\u2019t know where to start. I don\u2019t know many authors that aren\u2019t fantasy/scifi. Some of my favorite series are Stormlight Archive, Red Rising, WoT, LoTR.

But we will blow through those books, so I&#39;m looking for a series to read with her!

I&#39;ve had a rather violent loss in my family (a car accident), which has deprived the mother of a very young son. She&#39;s obviously having a hard time getting over it now.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to do something small to help her, and since I truly believe in the power of words, I&#39;d like to give her a book that can help her in some way. I&#39;d prefer some nonfiction, something &quot;real,&quot; even psychology-related, but I&#39;ll give you carte blanche. She&#39;s a believer, so if the book also addresses the issue from a Catholic/Christian perspective, it would be appreciated but not necessary.

I was excited to find Paulo Coelho&#39;s memoir about traveling the Hippie Trail, called <strong>Hippie</strong>. I won&#39;t leave a review because of the subreddit rule aboutreviews, but I was really very disappointed by it.</p> <p>I&#39;m hoping to find a better incarnation of the kind of book I was hoping for. Maybe Rick Steves&#39;s recent memoir will be better, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone has recommendations for other books about the Hippie Trail, whether novels, nonfiction, memoir.

I am an avid reader but I did not read much over the past 4-5 months since starting law school. Since much of law school is very dense reading, I am finding it difficult reading anything for fun since most of my mental energy is gone by the end of the day. </p> <p>Basically, my ask is for easy reading for the end of day that doesn\u2019t require much brain power. I have historically liked Emily Henry and Taylor Jenkins Reid for fun books, but I typically don\u2019t like to repeat. I actually turned to reading old American Girl books which has been a fun trip down memory lane but I have ripped through them rather quickly! </p> <p>Note: the flair is labeled fiction, but I am open to non-fiction as well so long as it falls under easy reads! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TopSea4326\"> /u/TopSea4326",

So as I was doom scrolling on Instagram, I came across Jimmy Fallons Book Club Suggestions, I ve downloaded them all - </p> <ol> <li>My friends - Fredrick A Novel - Fredrick Backman </li> <li>The Road To Tender Hearts - Annie Hartnett</li> <li>What Kind of Paradise - Janelle Brown </li> <li>What Will People Think - Sara Hamdan</li> <li>Maggie; or, man and a woman walk into a bar - Katie Yee. </li> </ol> <p>Most of this falls under my genre. From cozy books like SECRET SOCIETY OF IRREGULAR WITCHES to proper psychotic thrillers, I read them all. So anything that is a must read and will blow my mind out of proportion, please kindly suggest. </p> <p>I really would love to get back to reading.

I know there\u2019s a whole host of F1 romance novels that are just as popular as hockey romance novels but I was looking more for something where the main focus isn\u2019t romance and is more about the sport. I don\u2019t mind romance in the book at all, but I would prefer it to sort of secondary to the main plot. I\u2019d appreciate any recommendations! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KitAndTheMoon\"> /u/KitAndTheMoon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q1jk57/f1racing_novels_that_arent_strictly_romance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q1jk57/f1racing_novels_that_arent_strictly_romance/\">[comments]</a></span>",
