Also i discovered that its impossible now to create a google account without a phone number. It enraged me because they are everywhere.</p> <p>If you have any methods, tools, or best practices for someone who really wants to start fresh online, I\u2019d be happy to compensate someone for advice or step-by-step help. I already quite learned about Bitwarden password manager, Ublock Origin, DuckDuckGo and Tor, also Proton Mail and Vpns but id like to know more.

I also can\u2019t use a custom ROM or root my phone at the moment.</p> <p>With those limits in mind, does this still sound like a solid start? Any tips for degoogling without root/custom ROM while still ",

It seems to refuse to run in the background at all and only starts to back things up when I open the app. I also cannot see any of my photos from the desktop app, which i dont understand. My third complaint is that I actually would like image recognition in a photos app. It makes finding pictures of my dogs, cats, etc. so much easier.</p> <p>Any advice on any of these issues? Or recommendations for alternative services, especially private services that still provide #3 above (not sure if that\u2019s a thing)? It seems I\u2019m stuck with Apple and OneDrive for now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/string_bass\"> /u/string_bass </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1q1lvqz/disappointed_with_proton_drive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
