The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way.

While gamers might have an idea of where they ended up after finishing Fallout: New Vegas, it seems that a lot has changed in the wasteland in the 15 years since. While the meter didn\u2019t move too much on individual stories, it was great to see what some of these fan favorite factions are currently up to.</p><p>The episode opens up in a bottling plant for the infamous Sunset Sarsaparilla, the Mojave\u2019s favorite drink. The plant is being operated under the watchful eye of none other than former Brotherhood of Steel Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), who\u2019s taking on a far more ghoulish look than when we last saw him. After consoling a young girl who was bullied, he reminds the children to get back to work and that normally they\u2019d \u201cbe dead by now.\u201d</p><a href=\"https://www",
