HDD prices in Europe are astronomical and I pretty much have no other choice, but I also don&#39;t know where to look for good HDDs in the US.</p> <p>As I said in the title, I will be there for 1 week (can&#39;t have multi-week shipping times). I&#39;m looking for a single drive around 16-20TBs that is brand new and not refurbished. There was a deal for around 280$ for that at Bestbuy but it sold out, so I thought I&#39;d ask here for any similar offers.

Are there any decent solutions to add a 3rd hard drive to the 2 bay DAS? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m just going to have to buy a new much more massive internal HDD, transfer the data from the other 2 currently in the bay, and then replace them. Just didnt know if yall had any ideas of adding a 3rd one somehow. Im guessing no, but yall do some really interesting stuff in this sub haha.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/awclay91\"> /u/awclay91 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q1jz02/blew_through_the_space_on_my_2_bay_das_not/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q1jz02/blew_through_the_space_on_my_2_bay_das_not/\">[comments]</a></span>",
