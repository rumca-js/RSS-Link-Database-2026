        "description": "At the bottom of the earth there\u2019s a massive machine that\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen. That\u2019s because it\u2019s mostly buried under the ice and it\u2019s not looking at the stars\u2026 It\u2019s hunting ghosts! \n\nSpecifically, \u201cghost particles\u201d known as neutrinos. These mysterious particles come from somewhere in space and are smaller than an electron. \n\nWe can only spot them when one accidentally bumps into an atom and that rarely happens so scientists around the world have built massive \u201ctelescopes\u201d like this one to try and catch them as they pass \u2013 giving us a new way to map the universe. \n\n#shorts #space #iceCube #neutrinos #physics #science",
