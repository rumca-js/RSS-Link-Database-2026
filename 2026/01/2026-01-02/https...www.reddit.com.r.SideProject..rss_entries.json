TikTok&#39;s geo-restrictions kept killing my experiments, posting from one country tanks views in others because the algorithm favors local accounts.</p> <p>So I found a solution: a dashboard where local managers (real people in target countries) create accounts, post videos, and moderate on your behalf. No VPN nonsense, just legit SIM-verified profiles.</p> <p>The core flow is simple: you upload videos and set schedules via the dashboard. You pick a country (US, France, etc), and it&#39;s matched to a vetted local who handles everything. Pricing is credit-based.</p> <p>I learned a ton iterating on this. Started with just account creation, then added video bundling after testing showed 3x better engagement on geo-matched posts.</p> <p>If you&#39;re doing multi-country TikTok, check tokportal.

I&#39;d end up with the same artist back-to-back, or I&#39;d get conflicting genres right next to each other. So I made an app that lets you choose exactly how to shuffle your playlists. Some of the rules you can create include: Separate songs by Michael Jackson and Prince by at least 3 songs - Separate Jazz &amp; Dubstep songs by at least 1 song - Separate songs that start with the same 1 word by at least 10 songs - and many more customizable rules.
