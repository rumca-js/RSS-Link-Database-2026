I finished <strong>The Dictionary of Khazars</strong> by Milorad Pavi\u0107 in the afternoon of the 31st of December, making 66 books last year. ...I don&#39;t actually know if this vindicates the scoffing, but it gives me a sense of superiority over a completely unimportant metric.</p> <p>Anyway, the book. <strong>The Dictionary of the Khazars</strong> is a very interesting book, and a very fun read to unpack. It&#39;s not a traditional story in structure, though it isn&#39;t actually a dictionary, either, at least as I understand the term. The book has three nested narrative layers, centered around a potentially apocryphal event, the Khazar Polemic, where the leader of the Khazars (who were a real people, but not in any way like the people depicted in this book) invites three representatives from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, to espouse their religion",
