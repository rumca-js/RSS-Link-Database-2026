        "description": "Whenever we're setting up to record a video we ask a question to get the contributor to talk so we can check their microphone is working and set a level for recording. Traditionally, people ask 'what did you have for breakfast?' - we ask something different each year!\n\nMake sure you suggest your 2026 soundcheck question by commenting on the video! \n\nComputerphile is supported by Jane Street.
