        "description": "\u201cCyberpunk\u201d elicits many different responses depending on the generation. For the current, it may be, well, Cyberpunk 2077, perhaps even Edgerunners \u2013 of chooms bonding, becoming legends or fading away in the hellscape that is Night City. But the genre offers such a litany of capitalist viewscapes, where megastructures barely rise above the dregs and rogue artificial intelligences are more common than clean air, a dystopian wonderland a la Neuromancer or perhaps something more akin to 2000 AD's Mega-City One.\n\nAnd even if this nightmarish mix of living space constraints, run-down architecture and hotbeds of crime resembles today's world a little too closely for comfort, it's still enough to inspire wonder, like in emptyvessel's DEFECT.",

        "description": "Code Vein 2 is set to take the franchise in a new, more ambitious direction in early 2026. With a new story, revamped combat, improved weapon variety, refined animations and exploration and a whole lot more, this is a sequel that carries the weight of high expectations.  \n\nIt seems up to the task and might just live up to the hype that the original game's loyal community of fans has drummed up in the run up to its final release. If this one is more Code Vein in a better package, you can be sure we're not going to hesitate to dive right in.",
