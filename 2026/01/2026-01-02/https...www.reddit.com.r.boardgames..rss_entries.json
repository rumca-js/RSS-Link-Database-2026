Recently I have brought my girlfriends into this hobby by buying Sky Team and we have both become addicted and then i bought 7 wonder duels and it wasnt quite as big a hit since its not cooperative. But now im starting to get interested in Spirit Island since i have heard for a long time that its one the greats but also that it is quite a heavy game. So do you think we could pull it off and would it scare off my more casual girlfiend. And whats the best player count since i am writing this with the intentions of mostly playing it at 2 players at the beginning? Thanks in advance and happy new year.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YouAffectionate6963\"> /u/YouAffectionate6963 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1q1jwqu/spirit_island_with_casual_players/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
