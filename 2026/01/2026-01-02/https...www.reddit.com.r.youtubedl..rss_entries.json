I don&#39;t go for 2K or 4K because I consider 1080p optimum. So yt-dlp is working great in that scenario. Today though, I tried to download a 45+ minute video in 1440p. Yt-dlp did the job. Video was downloaded, my phone laaged a little bit, It was fine. But the problem was, that I included subtitles. Which turned the app into a nightmare. It took time. A lot of time. I tried to pause and resume again and again so it could be done faster. Didn&#39;t work. I waited for half an hour. I deleted the app and video altogether. I don&#39;t like something unfinished. So I&#39;m looking for alternatives. I have tried seal before. I remember uninstalling, I can&#39;t remember why. Counting on you. \ud83d\ude47 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kez60\"> /u/Kez60 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
