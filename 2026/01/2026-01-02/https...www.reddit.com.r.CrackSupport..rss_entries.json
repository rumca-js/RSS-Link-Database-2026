        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I downloaded gta 4 from steamrip and extracted fusion fix mod to its directory. The game did launch. However it put me directly in story mode rather than showing the menu where you either pick the dlc or the story mode. The gameplay amd cutscene was also stuttering so I shut it down. When I tried launching it again it isn&#39;t starting and shows error:D3D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Euphoric-Inspector41\"> /u/Euphoric-Inspector41 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1q1rfj5/does_fusion_fix_not_work_with_gta_4/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1q1rfj5/does_fusion_fix_not_work_with_gta_4/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I managed to download anadius&#39;s ea dlc unlocker but all the websites others have recommended on here for downloading the sims 4 dlc itself have been taken down or are no longer working. Does anyone have any advice?
