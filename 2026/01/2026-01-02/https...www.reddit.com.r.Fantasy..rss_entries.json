So I&#39;ve been scouring the Internet for comedic fantasy books. I&#39;ve picked up and put down at least a dozen supposedly funny fantasy books over the last year. Buying just about any book that was consistently rated as hilarous or laugh out loud funny, just to find out that the humor is mediocre at best or relies entirely on puns.</p> <p>After thinking maybe people just aren&#39;t funny anymore. I discovered... they were all American authors. Don&#39;t get me wrong.. there were a few I liked and laughed at.. but on the whole, their humor is pretty different to English humor. I think English humor relies more on situations that are parading as sensible but are instead rediculous...

I finished <strong>The Dictionary of Khazars</strong> by Milorad Pavi\u0107 in the afternoon of the 31st of December, making 66 books last year. ...I don&#39;t actually know if this vindicates the scoffing, but it gives me a sense of superiority over a completely unimportant metric.</p> <p>Anyway, the book. <strong>The Dictionary of the Khazars</strong> is a very interesting book, and a very fun read to unpack. It&#39;s not a traditional story in structure, though it isn&#39;t actually a dictionary, either, at least as I understand the term. The book has three nested narrative layers, centered around a potentially apocryphal event, the Khazar Polemic, where the leader of the Khazars (who were a real people, but not in any way like the people depicted in this book) invites three representatives from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, to espouse their religion",
