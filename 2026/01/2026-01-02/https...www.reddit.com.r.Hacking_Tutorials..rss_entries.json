Basically, I am trying to manually patch in an N64 mod into SM64 and I am struggling with figuring out if this is possible to patch the game files, then make the game back into a .z64 file, and be able to play it on not64 on my Wii. Any advice helps, thank you.</p> <p>(My posts keep getting removed from the wiihacks subreddit so this is the only spot I found to ask for help)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jealous-Clock-9911\"> /u/Jealous-Clock-9911 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1q256u3/rom_hack_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1q256u3/rom_hack_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",
