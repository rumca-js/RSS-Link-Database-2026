WRhythm is a music streaming app designed to support any subsonic API implementation (not just Navidrome). It&#39;s stable enough that I&#39;m able to use it for my runs the past week (and leave my phone behind). I&#39;ve tried it streaming from Navidrome and Gonic so far. So, not battle tested, but also not untested.</p> <p>I opened up a beta a few days ago <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/navidrome/comments/1q0bfxx/comment/nx5w6sn/\">targeting navidrome users</a>.

I also heard that it&#39;s good to create separate linux users for different services, but when I tried this I kept running into permission issues and when it comes to containers like Docker, that&#39;s an extra layer of complication that I can&#39;t wrap my head around.</p> <p>Basically, I would like to avoid an over-complicated setup that breaks due to permissions all the time and I have to spend hours debugging. At the same time, I don&#39;t want to do something as insecure as running everything as root. The question is what is a reasonable setup for a home server where I get adequate security for my sensitive data (password manager, nextcloud, etc.) but I don&#39;t needlessly overcomplicate the setup?
