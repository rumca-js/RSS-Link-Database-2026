Really helpful when you want to stay informed but don&#39;t have time to read everything.</p> <p>You can add your own RSS feeds, set up alerts for keywords you care about, and there&#39;s even some fun daily puzzles (crosswords, word search, news quiz) if you need a break.</p> <p>Would mean a lot if you checked it out. Open to all feedback - good or bad!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/apemanor\"> /u/apemanor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1q1nuq5/built_a_news_app_that_uses_ai_to_summarize/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1q1nuq5/built_a_news_app_that_uses_ai_to_summarize/\">[comments]</a></span>",
