        "description": "What does it feel like to see Earth from outer space and imagine humanity's next steps? Astronaut Chris Hadfield, who has flown two Space Shuttle missions and served as commander of the International Space Station, explores the recent leaps in space exploration. From the thrills and risks of commercial space travel to collaborating as a species to shape the future, Hadfield reflects on what inspires innovation and our dreams of visiting the stars.
