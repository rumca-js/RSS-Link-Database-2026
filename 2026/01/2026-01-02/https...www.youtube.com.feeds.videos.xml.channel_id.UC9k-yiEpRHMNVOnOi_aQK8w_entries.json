She was a quarter mile from home without a cell phone and the only thing she could do was crawl. Eventually her son showed up looking for her. In New Jersey, a lifeguard was impaled by a beach umbrella in a freak accident. Doctors had to cut the pole out of Alex Kaus' shoulder. And, brave little Leah Lendel survived a shark attack.",
