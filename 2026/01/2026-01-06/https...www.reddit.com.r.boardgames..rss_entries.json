I also own the White deck as well, since I have a spending problem, but haven&#39;t cracked it open yet. My understanding is that the game can drastically change based on what deck you are playing, and that Red is the most difficult. Red, however, is what comes with the core starter pack now, so this is what I will focus on. </p> <p>Let me begin by saying I was extremely excited for this game. I enjoy solo games, and I enjoy difficult games.

Of course this method of making new games is kinda jury rigging old cards.
