I saw stuff about mini PC boards with N100 CPUs ,10Gig Lan and 6 SATA ports or similar for cheap, but those seem to have risen by about 50% too and I imagine there is little to no CPU headroom. I may wait until ram prices stabilize, so incase new options appear, what should I look out for?</p> <p>I appreciate any advice. Honestly ideally I would have wanted to pay 400\u20ac not including the NAS storage, but I think that is no longer realistic with the prices rising, so I&#39;d also appreciate a different suggested budget or an estimate of what it may cost.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/643310\"> /u/643310 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

Can someone recommend a good quiet drive?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PersonSuitTV\"> /u/PersonSuitTV </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q5nr9d/could_someone_recommend_quiet_35_drives/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1q5nr9d/could_someone_recommend_quiet_35_drives/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I bought an Acasis enclosure (TBU405) which was supposed to be thunderbolt 4 compatible, but i got really slow speeds in the blackmagic speed test, even it was recognized in the thunderbolt control center, speeds were the same as if i connected it in the frontal usb c port. I updated the bios and firmware and follower every troubleshooting guide I could find to no avail so i returned it. Then I bought the Qwizlab usb4 40gbs enclosure and i got the same result. Is there an enclosure that works with this thunderbolt ports, is this an incompatibility issue?
