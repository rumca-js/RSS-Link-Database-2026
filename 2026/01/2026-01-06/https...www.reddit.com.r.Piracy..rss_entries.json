I wanna know how dangerous it is to try out torrenting for games with any run-of-the-mill VPN (For example ProtonVPN). Also are there any recomandations for a Free VPN that is strictly used for Torrenting games? i know that i am the product and &quot;Free VPN?&quot; bla bla bla</p> <p>Edit: for anyone scared for me.

Any idea how to retrieve the name of the song? </p> <p>ChatGPT says download your Spotify data and I already sent my request and will be here within 30 days. But in case it doesn&#39;t have the name. What other ways can i try? SpotDL or something like that.</p> <p>Btw just bit of a rant. This is a Spotify PREMIUM experience, at least show that the track is unavailable like Youtube.
