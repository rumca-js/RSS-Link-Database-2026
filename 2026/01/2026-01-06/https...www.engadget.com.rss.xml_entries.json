The new tech promises a gaming experience that\u2019s free of stutter with buttery smooth motion, which is made possible by pulsing the display\u2019s backlight. G-Sync Pulsar displays have multiple horizontal backlight sections that are pulsed independently from top to bottom, unlike traditional displays whose backlight is always on. When the backlight is always active, the image fades from one frame to the next. The displays with the new tech give pixels in a frame enough time to stabilize before they\u2019re backlit so that they\u2019re shown in their right locations, effectively reducing monitor-based motion blur.  </p><p>The company says G-Sync Pulsar can effectively quadruple your refresh rate.
