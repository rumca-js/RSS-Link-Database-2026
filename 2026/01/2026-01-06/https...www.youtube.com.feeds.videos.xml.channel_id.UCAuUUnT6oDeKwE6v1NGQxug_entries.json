        "description": "2026 is a tipping point year, says Ian Bremmer, founder of Eurasia Group. Highlighting the top risks that await the world, he breaks down the US military extraction of Venezuela leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and explains why US President Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of the \u201cDonroe doctrine\u201d kicks off the most uncertain geopolitical environment in decades. With stark insights on what's to come in Europe, Russia and China, this is a can't-miss look at the volatile world order.
