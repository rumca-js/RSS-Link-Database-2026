Lawmakers tout these laws as the silver-bullet solution to \u201ckids\u2019 online safety,\u201d but in reality, age-verification mandates wall off large swaths of the web, build sweeping new surveillance infrastructure, increase the risk of data breaches and real-life privacy harms, and threaten the anonymity that has long allowed people to seek support, explore new ideas, and organize and build community online.</span><br /><br /><span",
