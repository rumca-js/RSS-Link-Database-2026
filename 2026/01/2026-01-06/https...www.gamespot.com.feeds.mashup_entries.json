With the game now available on both the original Switch and the Switch 2 (with an <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-finally-getting-new-content-and-switch-2-upgrade/1100-6535819/\">even <em>more</em> upgraded Switch 2 Edition landing January 15</a>), Nintendo's flagship cozy game is back. Whether you've been playing consistently since launch, or want to dive back in and see what your villagers have been up to over the past few years, you may be looking to make your grand entrance on a shiny new Switch 2. Doing so, though, will require you to first move your island to Nintendo's newest console. Here's how to do so using the Animal Crossing island transfer tool.</p><div data-embed-type=\"toc\"><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=",

Here, it's only two buttons: up and down. And while there are more traditional gameplay moments--like minigames where you must memorize movement patterns and react to the beat of different tempos--in a similar fashion to Rhythm Heaven, it's the harmonious intersection with all the game's other sections, which would normally play out as mere cutscenes, that makes Unbeatable stand out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A decade ago, right around the time that R",
