        "description": "This course, from Rola Dali, PhD, provides a comprehensive overview of agentic AI, defining agents as software entities that use LLMs to perceive environments, make decisions, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. It explores the critical distinction between static workflows and dynamic agentic systems, emphasizing how LLMs serve as a reasoning \"brain\" to decompose tasks at runtime. Through practical Python demonstrations, the course covers essential components like system prompts, tools, and memory, while also comparing architectural patterns such as Supervisor and Swarm. Finally, the session addresses the future of technology by discussing emerging interoperability protocols like MCP and the shifting paradigms of software development in an AI-driven world.\n\nSlides and Labs: https://github.com/rdali/ML105_Agents\n\nProfile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/roladali/\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive le",
