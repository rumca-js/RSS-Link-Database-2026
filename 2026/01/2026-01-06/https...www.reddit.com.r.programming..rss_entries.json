The main objective I pursue is to get some attention to my thoughts on the proper code review and to get feedback from other developers based on their opinion and experience. The specific recommendations there are mostly based on my experience, but I tried to generalize the approach as much as possible so it is relevant for any software development project. I have already tried this approach in several teams and projects, and it worked very well. That&#39;s why I want to share it, get feedback from a wider audience, and understand if that is a really valuable approach or just something very specific that won&#39;t be useful for others.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/areklanga\"> /u/areklanga </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://bastrich.tech/perfect-code-review/\">[link]</a><",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Virtual threads (Project Loom) are lightweight threads managed by the JVM instead of the OS. They let you write simple blocking code while scaling to thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks.</p> <p>The big win is that you don\u2019t need to redesign your app around async or reactive patterns just to handle concurrency. Existing blocking APIs (HTTP, JDBC, etc.) work naturally, and the JVM handles scheduling efficiently.</p> <p>They\u2019re especially useful for I/O-bound workloads like web servers, microservices, and background jobs. That said, they\u2019re not a silver bullet\u2014CPU-bound work still needs limits, and poorly designed blocking can still cause problems.</p> <p>Overall, virtual threads make concurrent Java code simpler and more approachable without giving up scalability.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aravindcsebe\"> /u/aravindcsebe </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@aravindcsebe/virt",
