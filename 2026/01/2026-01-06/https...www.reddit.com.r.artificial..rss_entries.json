While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1\\% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors",

But I want to get some feedback on the tracks I&#39;m creating. Obviously AI can&#39;t &quot;listen&quot; to it in the traditional, human sense, but it can&#39;t really &quot;think&quot; about the quality of an e-mail you&#39;re working on, either, yet it is able to analyze anyway. I asked the usual suspect, ChatGPT, but it keeps fighting me on it. At first it DID provide evaluation, but now it&#39;s saying that it can only listen to audio files SOMETIMES, and that there is no rhyme or reason to when it can (even for paid members). I am hoping for an AI tool which I can rely on for this purpose! That does so consistently and not arbitrarily like this.
