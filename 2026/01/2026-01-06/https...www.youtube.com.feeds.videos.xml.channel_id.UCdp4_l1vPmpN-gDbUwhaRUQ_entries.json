        "description": "Ever wondered how a computer mouse actually works? \ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f Using clean and easy-to-follow 3D animation, this short takes you inside one of the most important tools we use every day. Beneath its simple design is smart technology working constantly in real time.\n\nAn optical sensor on the bottom of the mouse scans the surface thousands of times per second. A tiny processor compares these images to detect direction and speed, turning your hand movements into smooth cursor motion on screen. Each click activates precise switches that instantly send signals to your computer, while the scroll wheel uses a rotating encoder to control scrolling with accuracy.\n\nWhether wired or wireless, the mouse communicates with your computer in milliseconds, making everything feel fast and effortless. From browsing and gaming to design and animation, this small device plays a big role in how we interact with digital worlds.\n\nWatch the Full Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAaESb4wTCM&t=24s",
