My setup consists of the official Pi Display v1.1 and a Raspberry Pi 3B running Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit.</p> <p>When I search online for how to rotate the screen, most sources say that I need to add the line<br/> lcd_rotate=2 to /boot/firmware/config.txt (online guides often mention /boot/config.txt , but this has changed). However, this does not work for me. I discovered that if I disable the line dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d, the screen does rotate 180 degrees, but the GUI no longer loads.</p> <p>I then tried a different approach by adding the following line to<br/> /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt:<br/> video=DSI-1:800x480@60,rotate=180</p> <p>This rotates both the screen and the GUI correctly, but the touchscreen input is not rotated. For example, pressing the bottom-right of the screen opens the start menu in the top-left corner.</p> <p>Does anyone have experien",
