        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Continuation novels are a time honored publishing tradition. I was sorting a library at the home where my uncle resides, and was struck at the sheer volume of continuation novels they had on the shelves. Evidently Tom Clancy has written 100+ books since his death, and Clive Cussler isn&#39;t far behind. These continue a strong tradition from the pulps, but other genres have plenty as well. What are your favorites, and what should be avoided at all costs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/drewogatory\"> /u/drewogatory </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q59bel/best_continuation_novels/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q59bel/best_continuation_novels/\">[comments]</a></span>",
