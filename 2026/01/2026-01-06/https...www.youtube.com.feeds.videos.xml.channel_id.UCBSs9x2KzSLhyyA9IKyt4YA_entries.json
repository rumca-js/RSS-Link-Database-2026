        "description": "Tsukuyomi is a virtual space of hopes and dreams. The curtain rises on a stage on which young girls share fleeting encounters.\n\nIn the very near future...\nIroha Sakayori, a 17-year-old high school student in Tokyo, leads an extremely busy life trying to balance part-time work and academics. She finds peace by watching a popular streamer named Yachiyo Runami, who is the administrator of an online virtual space called Tsukuyomi.\n\nIroha frequents Tsukuyomi, where people can make clones of themselves and freely pursue their creativity, and she passes the time by supporting Yachiyo and playing a battle game to earn a little extra money. On her way home one day, Iroha finds a utility pole shining with iridescent hues. To her surprise, an adorable baby emerges from the pole. Unable to abandon it, Iroha takes the infant home and watches her rapidly grow into a girl her own age.\n\"Are you Princess Kaguya?\"\n\nThis is the tale of Princess Kaguya as never seen before.\n\nWatch on Netflix: https://www",
