There are reports of protests in a further 11 provinces.\n \nThe wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Iran #BBCNews",

However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.\n \nLooming larger over the talks is Trump's insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Zelensky #Macron #Paris #Greenland #BBCNews",
