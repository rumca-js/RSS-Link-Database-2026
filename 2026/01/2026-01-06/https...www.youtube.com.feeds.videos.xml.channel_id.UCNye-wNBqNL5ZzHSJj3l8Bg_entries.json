Earlier, Syria\u2019s defence ministry said three soldiers were injured after SDF fired drones at a military checkpoint near Deir Hafer, east of northern province.\nHeavy machine gunfire and fighting have been reported in the areas of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafiyah. The ministry says it will respond to the \u201caggression in an appropriate manner\u201d.\nThe incident comes after a SDF delegation held talks with the government in Damascus. The stalled discussions were about integrating SDF fighters into Syria\u2019s national army. At least two people were killed after clashes broke out between the Syrian army and SDF in Aleppo late last month.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Ayman Oghanna joins us live from Beit Jinn in southern Syria to discuss the latest developments. \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http:",
