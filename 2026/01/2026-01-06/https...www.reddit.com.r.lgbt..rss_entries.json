We didn&#39;t know about eachother until one day in 2015, after finding out about the people we were dating, our parents sat both of us in the couch and shouted at us for being gay. We looked at eachother confused and when the realisation we were both queer hit, we were bewildered. I was 15 at the time and dating a girl, he was 23 and dating a guy. When I clarified to my parents I wasn&#39;t a lesbian, but bi, their first reaction was &quot;that doesn&#39;t exist, you&#39;re a lesbian in denial&quot;. After my brother reassured them it existed, they gave me the following &quot;advice&quot;: &quot;then date men exclusively, be straight&quot;. At first this sounded ridiculous, but as the time went by the psychological violence my parents were exerting over me became more unbearable. My brother was already living alone so I didn&#39;t even have his support and he never spoke of that day again. Even",

And in this version your still forced to get married and when it was my turn to get married my dad got out a man and I said I&#39;d marry the car instead. And I think my sister caught on and asked if I&#39;d rather have a wife. And I said yes and surprising my dad got out a woman for me to marry. And he was fine with it the rest of the game.

So I talked to my gay friend about how he came to realise he was gay not bi and he said when he was making out with his past girlfriend he didn\u2019t really feel anything and then he had this crush on a guy that just made him realise.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had an experience like that before so I thought I would try replicate it with porn. I watched straight porn and it didn\u2019t really arouse me and I mostly looked at the guys. I then watched gay porn and that really aroused me and stuff.</p> <p>So now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m bi or gay mostly because while I thought I was bi, I had crushes on girls, but know I\u2019m not sure if I was really attracted to them or if it was just wow she\u2019s so pretty and nice and stuff.

I have colleagues who were affected by the anti-trans policies of the Department of War by which they were forced to separate from the military. I made the decision to donate the full amount to pro-LGBTQ causes even though I am a straight, cis person. I wanted to do something right for the people who were alienated and force to give up their service regardless of their efforts or positive impact on the country. It&#39;s a disgrace and even though my contribution is small, I still hope that someone will see this and know that there are service members who will fight for them. That&#39;s all. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prettygoodhandle\"> /u/prettygoodhandle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1q53bdl/donated_my_warrior_dividend_to_lgbtq_causes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/l",
