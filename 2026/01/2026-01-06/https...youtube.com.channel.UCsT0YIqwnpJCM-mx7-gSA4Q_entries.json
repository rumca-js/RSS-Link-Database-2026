Johannes Fritz shares how, together with his team, he not only attempted the impossible\u2014but succeeded\u2014proving that nurturing hope, even amid daunting challenges and unexpected setbacks, can lead to extraordinary outcomes.\n\nIl biologo comportamentale austriaco Johannes Fritz \u00e8 un pioniere nella conservazione delle specie e ha dedicato 25 anni a salvare l'Ibis Eremita settentrionale dall'estinzione, guidando uno dei progetti di reintroduzione pi\u00f9 ambiziosi d'Europa. Ha sviluppato l'unico metodo al mondo di migrazione degli uccelli guidata dall'uomo, utilizzando aerei ultraleggeri per insegnare agli ibis cresciuti in cattivit\u00e0 la loro rotta ancestrale attraverso le Alpi. Oggi oltre 300 Ibis Eremita settentrionali vivono allo stato brado in Europa. \n\nAustrian behavioral biologist Johannes Fritz is a pioneer in species conservation. He has dedicated his life to saving the Northern Bald Ibis from extinction, leading one of Europe's",

        "description": "Muon imaging uses naturally occurring cosmic radiation to look inside sealed objects without any active radiation source. In this talk, you\u2019ll discover where muons come from, how they enable powerful imaging, and why this technique can distinguish materials by density and composition. From detecting shielded contraband in shipping containers to future applications like nuclear cask monitoring, this presentation offers an exciting glimpse into the potential of muon-based imaging. Sarah is a particle physicist from the United Kingdom and currently leads the Methods and Processing group at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute for the Protection of Maritime Infrastructures. She earned her master\u2019s degree in physics at the University of Sheffield before pursuing a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Manchester, where she contributed to the ATLAS experiment at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.\nOver the past eight years, her research interests have expande",
