Microsoft has given an explanation for it (spotted by <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2026/01/05/why-windows-11-clipboard-is-a-hit-or-miss-sometimes-according-to-microsoft/\">Windows Latest</a>), citing Clipboard History\u2019s asynchronous design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Clipboard History gets updated in the background after Windows receives a signal that something has been copied.

In fact, I recall it catching my eye in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>.

The array of sensors allows the mower to adapt in real time to changes in the environment, a critical feature for homeowners with pets, kids, or complex landscaping.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"imageId\":\"695c61ad4e394\"}' data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img deco",
