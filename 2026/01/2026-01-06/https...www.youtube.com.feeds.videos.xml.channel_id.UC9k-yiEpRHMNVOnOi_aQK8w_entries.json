        "description": "The time has come for many to get rid of their Christmas trees. Inside Edition's Alison Hall decided to feed her tree to the goats at Cropsey Farms in New City, New York. The goats eat all the needles and even the bark. On average, each goat eats one tree a day. There are other easy ways to dispose of a Christmas tree. Many municipalities have drop off areas for recycling. Depending on where you live, you can put your Christmas tree on the curb and the sanitation department will take it away.",
