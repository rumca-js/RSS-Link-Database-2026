I&#39;ve been working on Varlico - a search engine for AI-generated music, videos, and art.</p> <p><strong>The problem:</strong> 160,000+ AI creations are made daily across multiple platforms. Amazing work exists, but it&#39;s scattered, buried, and impossible to find. Right now, discovery is broken - you either scroll algorithmic feeds or manually browse individual platforms.</p> <p><strong>Why I&#39;m building this:</strong> This feels like the web in 1995. Information everywhere, no way to organize it. Manual directories couldn&#39;t scale. Search infrastructure won.</p> <p>I believe AI content is having that same moment right now?</p> <p><strong>What I built:</strong> A search layer that aggregates AI content and ranks it by quality rather than just virality. I call it MeaningRank - it scores content based on:</p> <ul> <li>Creative transparency (how it was made)</li> <li>Originality (not derivative)<",

The &#39;best time to post&#39; advice you find online is often uselessly generic. <a href=\"/r/remotework\">r/remotework</a> was most active very early EST (like 5-6 AM), which makes sense for people checking before their day starts. <a href=\"/r/productivity\">r/productivity</a> had a huge spike around 1 PM EST (lunch break scrolling, maybe?). <a href=\"/",
