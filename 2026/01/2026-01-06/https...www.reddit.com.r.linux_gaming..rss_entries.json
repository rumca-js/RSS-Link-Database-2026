        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have seen almost 400W drawn when I ran an OCCT GPU benchmark, my GPU is an Asrock Steel Legend 9070XT. I found here that there was a kernel patch to just let all 9070XT\u2019s use up to 374 watts. (<a href=\"https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/power-ceiling-increased-out-of-nowhere-for-9070-xt/14650/4\">https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/power-ceiling-increased-out-of-nowhere-for-9070-xt/14650/4</a>), not sure why OCCT is reporting 396W+ in the main header where it shows power use. I\u2019m wondering if this increased power use would also translate to higher transient spikes. On windows with a 304W limit as defined by the card, I see a total graphics power of around 530W and an 850W PSU in my prebuilt pc. Secondary question, would limiting it to 304W with LACT end up making the spikes more in line with windows, if 374+W means they would be higher? I use Bazzite.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DragonReborn97\"> /u/Drag",

And yes I tried the WAYLAND environment variables but it doesn&#39;t work and I m running the latest NVIDIA drivers for my RTX4090.</p> <p>I spent hours and hours trying to fix it. I thought maybe reinstall it and stay on Fedora 42, but I found out that Fedora 42 is almost end of life.</p> <p>On my work laptop(Dell with a Quaddro P2000) I m still running Fedora 42 with also X11 because of Teams and Slack.</p> <p>So how are you Nvidia folks dealing with this? Do I need to switch to another distro that still sticks to X11?</p> <p>One important detail is that I have dual boot with windows 11 so I need secure boot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I have tried a few suggestions about changing the udev rules, but I just can&#39;t make it work. Connecting through the 2.4ghz dongle, it pairs, but it is not recognized as a controller. Directly through the cable the leds keep blinking, and it does not even connect. Bluetooth on D-mode connects and disconnects constantly. At least I have the USB adapter V2 and there it connects in Switch mode just fine. I&#39;ve tried the 3 available firmwares for the controller and none of them work with my PC. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions?

This happens because <code>nvidia-powerd</code> doesn&#39;t always refresh correctly when the ACPI profile changes.</p> <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I created a lightweight systemd automation that monitors the power profile file. When you press Fn+Q, it automatically restarts the <code>nvidia-powerd.service</code> after a short delay to ensure the full 85W limit is applied.</p> <p>It uses a <code>systemd.path</code> unit, so it consumes <strong>zero CPU</strong> while waiting\u2014it only reacts when the profile actually changes.</p> <p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/jaakko18-wq/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Gaming-3-Leg",

I have had a longstanding issue with GNOME where my mouse cursor escapes from my full-screen games if I move the cursor quickly and click at the same time... In an effort to find a solution, I was suggested gamescope to solve this problem! While this worked well, I frequently swap between gaming on my laptop display (1920x1200) and my monitors (2560x1440). This of course led to me being required to constantly change the resolution of my display in my steam launch command and in my opinion was not a viable solution. As such, I created this script which detects the true resolution of your primary display and feeds it into a gamescope launch command and runs said command. This completely automates the process of fiddling with resolution values in your steam launch commands and allows you to simply run &quot;autoscope %command%&quot;. This is my first time creating and running a github repo and project so if I made any mistakes please lmk so",
