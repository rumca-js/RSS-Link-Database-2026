I&#39;ve been building Corefeed, an iOS feed reader that unifies articles, podcasts, and YouTube channels in a single timeline.</p> <p>The initial idea started because I wanted time-based grouping (last hour, today, this week, etc.) of entries rather than just endless chronological scrolling. I thought this would make it easier to stay on top of my feeds when I don&#39;t check in for a couple of days. I also wanted to experiment with Apple&#39;s Foundation Models, so I added optional AI-generated digests and briefings features.</p> <p>As I progressed, the idea developed more into a mixing articles, podcasts, and YoutTube channels in a timeline. The app now supports RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, podcast feeds (both traditional and Podcasting 2.0 spec), plus YouTube channels (excluding shorts). It now has a nice minimal-but-enough podcast player, automatic tags generated for each article (for filters) with Apple Intelligence (when available), feed",
