Let\u2019s take a closer look at the stats\u2026 \n\nThe Ford Fiesta ST is powered by 1.5 turbocharged 3-cylinder 200hp and 320Nm. This power is sent to the front wheels only via a 6-speed manual gearbox, and it\u2019s the lightest car here, at 1,283kg. When new, it costs around \u00a327,000. \n\nAlongside it is the Volkswagen Polo GTI. It\u2019s packing a 2-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder, and this puts down 207hp and 320Nm. It\u2019s equipped with a 7-speed automatic gearbox which sends power to the front wheels, and it tips the scales at 1,296kg. It costs just over \u00a331,000.\n\nUp next is the MINI Cooper JCW. Like the Polo, it also has a 2-litre 4-cylinder turbo, and it produces 231hp and 380Nm. ",
