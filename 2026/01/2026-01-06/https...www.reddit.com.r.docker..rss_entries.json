I don\u2019t have much experience with Docker or FFmpeg, so I\u2019ve tried several approaches but keep hitting errors.</p> <p>I\u2019m running a few local automations where I need to convert images into videos. FFmpeg seems like the best option, as other alternatives are either expensive or less powerful. From what I understand, the main issue is that my Mac uses <strong>ARM64</strong>, while most FFmpeg Docker images are built for <strong>AMD64</strong>, which seems to cause the errors.</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate any guidance from someone who has faced this before.<br/> Also, if you have insights on how to solve this through an <strong>API</strong> instead of directly using Docker, that would be amazing.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Emergency_Back1287\"> /u/Emergency_Back1287 ",
