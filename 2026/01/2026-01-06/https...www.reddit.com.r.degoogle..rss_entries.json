Although I have moved towards a Google-free lifestyle and am preparing to switch to Linux by June 2026, I still encounter persistent issues with Google&#39;s legacy permissions. </p> <p>Specifically, an app I have already uninstalled (K-9 Mail) still shows as having &#39;access&#39; to my account in Google&#39;s security records. When I attempt to manually revoke this access to clean my digital footprint, I get stuck in a security verification loop because I do not use Google\u2019s standard tracking and recovery tools. </p> <p>How can I force Google to &#39;forget&#39; these app connections and update its security logs without being forced into their complex account recovery traps?
