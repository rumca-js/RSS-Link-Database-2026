One is to say round numbers are irrelevant. Since share prices are meant to go up over the long term, an index that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/02/footsie-40-ftse-100-index-tech-stocks\">created in 1984</a> at a starting value of 1,000 was bound to get there eventually.</p><p>In any case, a pure value-weighted points measure doesn\u2019t capture the dividends paid by component companies, which can add up to a material part of an investor\u2019s return over time if reinvested. Nor is the Footsie guaranteed to stay above 10,000, obviously.

Neil Harvey was once the youngest of Bradman\u2019s Invincibles; now he\u2019s 97, his old cricketing buddies gone.

During a 15-year Test career, he cut and shimmied to more than 6,000 runs at an average of 48, making his mark with 153 in his second Test. He was a regular at the SCG, attending every Test from 1949 up until four years ago, when, in the words of his son Bruce he \u201cgave up public appearances\u201d and he has very fond memories of the place.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/06/i-wish-id-faced-t",

His second ball was both short and wide and hacked over gully by Travis Head. His third ball was short and straight and smashed past midwicket by Travis Head. His fourth ball was defended with a show of furrowed caution, to loud, mocking cheers from a crowd that had begun to tuck into the day. Welcome to the treadmill, Pottsy. And yes, it\u2019s always like this around here.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/06/conscript-matt-potts-england-paratrooper-fighting-lonely-ashes-war-sydney-cricket\">Continue reading...</a>",

In Barcelona it was a bold plan to rid the city \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s most visited \u2013 of tourist flats by late 2028. And in Paris, it was a drastic makeover; one that included making the Seine swimmable and turning its car-clogged riverbanks into pedestrian-friendly areas.</p><p>The mayors\u2019 actions \u2013 and the global conversation they elicited \u2013 hinted at how, in much of the world, the role of mayor has been recast.
