CGT is one of the critical drivers of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude heat waves. However, how the structure of CGT responds to global warming and its effect on future heat wave characteristics remains inconclusive.",

Pheomelanin is an orange-to-red pigment that is built with the amino acid cysteine and found in human red hair and fair skin, as well as in bird feathers. Previous research has shown that pheomelanin is associated with increased melanoma risk, raising questions about why evolution has maintained genetic variants that promote pheomelanin production.",

        "description": "One of the main questions in exoplanet science concerns M dwarfs (red dwarfs) and the habitability of exoplanets that orbit them. These stars are known for their prolific and energetic flaring, and that's a problem. M dwarfs are so small that their habitable zones are in tight proximity to them, putting any potentially habitable planets in the direct line of fire of all this dangerous flaring.",
