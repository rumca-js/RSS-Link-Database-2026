I&#39;ve also been thinking about how urging individual charity can distract from systemic underfunding, which can only be addressed with systemic solutions.</p> <p>So, I wanted to gauge the community&#39;s thoughts on <strong>Government Grants</strong>. That is, a nation-state gives money to FOSS developers to work on their software. I&#39;ll outline some of the advantages I think it has, the precedents for this sort of thing, and concerns I (expect) people might have.</p> <h2>How does the Government decide who to fund??</h2>",

Despite still using Gmail, Facebook, Amazon Alexa and all sorts of things that make it pretty moot I fully acknowledge.</p> <p>But I&#39;ve had to move back to Chrome as Firefox&#39;s memory usage just seems broken. I work in IT and have two browser sessions, one for personal use, one for work use. And I don&#39;t have control over how well many of the sites I use are written. Salesforce, for example, is just awful. Easily using 2gb for a single tab.</p> <p>In general I&#39;ll have maybe 25 tabs open across two browser instances. That&#39;s not a lot really is it? When people complain about running out of memory they get told to close most of the 935 tabs they have, but really 25 to 30 isn&#39;t many these days, in a working environment. I don&#39;t think so at least.</p> <p>With Firefox this often lead to running out of memory on",
