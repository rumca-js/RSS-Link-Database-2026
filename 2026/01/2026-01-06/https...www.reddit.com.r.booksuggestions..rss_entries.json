I\u2019m looking for something to read with a strong but realistic female protagonist, preferably sapphic. I\u2019m not against straight romance or anything lol and I actually really like it when it\u2019s well-written but I guess I\u2019m just looking for something I can relate to better.</p> <p>I really liked Burningblade and Silvereye by Django Wexler, especially with the dual protagonists (sister and brother, both with great storylines and their respective romances), but I doubt anything else fits that specific niche lol.

Now I want to learn more about space travel and its theories, about neutrinos, gravitational waves, the solar system, light speed, nuclear pulse propulsion, and so on. </p> <p>So far I only found books for kids or non-fiction stories by astronauts.

Books like Atomic Habits (a book I have heard a lot about), as well as psychology and philosophy, all seem interesting but overwhelming. I really want to give them a try, but I have no idea where to start.</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or recommendations you all have!

I also found &quot;Hard Copy: A Story of Girl Meets Printer&quot; by Fien Veldman (title self explanatory) which I also loved and thought was a similarly wonderful premise and execution.</p> <p>I have found a few other books that are pretty much just random fanfiction-esque romance books, often with sentient objects, but that is NOT what I want. I want books that explore the concept of people in love with inanimate objects, and exploring their life or psychology. If they are delusional, even better.

I\u2019m a 3D designer but I\u2019ve been feeling really stuck and blocked since I lost my job, I\u2019m from Mexico so I can read in Spanish too.

I think my main issue is indecisiveness. Last year I read The Troop by Nick Cutter, Wings of Starlight by Allison Saft, The Nightingale by Kristen Hannah, I Who Have Never Known Men by Jaqueline Harpman and The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides. Loved the Nightinagle and the Troop, hated The Silent Patient. I don\u2019t like sticking to one genre, I have a very hard time with fantasy. I tend to go for horror or emotional romances. I recently watched The Long Walk which I heard is based off a Stephen King novel, I\u2019m not too into his writing but absolutely loved the concept of the movie/book and would love to find something like that to read.
