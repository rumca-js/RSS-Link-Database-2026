No permanent record, ever.</p> <p>Read others&#39; secrets, react with simple buttons (Forgive? Impossible? Disaster?), or add anonymous comments while the timer ticks down.</p> <p>It&#39;s oddly satisfying watching them fade away.</p> <p>Early days, so confessions are fresh and limited \u2013 but that&#39;s part of the magic.</p> <p>What do you think?
