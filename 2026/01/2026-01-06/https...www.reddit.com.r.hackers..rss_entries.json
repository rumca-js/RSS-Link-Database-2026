Ima make it simple.</p> <p>I met her on tinder, talked for 4 months became mutual friends who talked on the phone, never met. </p> <p>Found a new girl cut her off, she went crazy and started stalking me. </p> <p>She makes ig accounts and leaves comments on my post. She calls from fake numbers, broken lines, she is even trying to make me look bad and calling her place of work under these fake Google numbers.</p> <p>Police are involved and saying they are gonna track the Iap address where these accounts and numbers were made.</p> <p>It is 100% her doing it. Ive moved on but she stalks me.</p> <p>My question is, should I have anything to worry about? Will they be able to accurately trace her IP address or what I fear, would she be able to link it to mine? If she knows how to make fake goodlgle numbers then maybe she knows how to manipulate IP addresses.</p> <p>Im hop8ng it blows up in her face and its successfully",

When she went on to transfer money from savings to checking, the hacker stole $1800 from her account into blockchain in India (we&#39;re from the USA). She called the bank and I guess froze everything and that &quot;the bank is working on getting her money back&quot;.</p> <p>I had an issue before where fanduel stole like $100 from me, but I got it back after filing the report. What&#39;s the likelihood she gets this money back? These scumbags use crypto on purpose so it can&#39;t be retrieved easily? I guess it&#39;s time to stop free movies and sports streaming sites... sucks as I&#39;ve done this my whole life with no issues and have saved so much money.</p> <p>She uses Santander banking btw.</p> <p>Why is India like the #1 scamming nation of the world?
