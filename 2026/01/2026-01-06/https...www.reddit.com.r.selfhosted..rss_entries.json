After that, fast forward 2 weeks, YouTube recommended a video by Jeff Geerling named &quot;Project MINI RACK&quot; which got my attention. I also watched some tutorials and videos for a &quot;PiHole&quot; and an own media server or media library which could be based on my DVD collection. I would also love to add a firewall to my internet connection just to make it a bit safer :)</p> <p>Now my question was: What would you recommend to get and how could i pull that off?

If it was a OTP I would&#39;ve payed instantly. OPDS worked perfectly, too.</p> <p>Komga / Booklore - I don\u2019t remember which had which problem. Tried them around the same time: File management is awful. I group my books by series. It forced me to manually add &quot;series&quot; metadata tags to each individual book to allow collapse / sort by series. I have them organized i",

What if the whole box goes out or a NIC fails or the power goes out while you&#39;re away. How do you guys handle those cases?
