Star Wars: Outlaws, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine, and Resident Evil Village are headlining the service. Resident Evil is particularly timely, considering Requiem drops next month. In other news, PlayStation has patented a new AI Assists feature that can take over if you're stuck in a game. The model can be trained on previous playing sessions or from clips posted to YouTube and Twitch, and can player progress on a granular level in order to understand what they're trying to achieve. And finally, Nvidia has introduced DLSS 4.5, with improved image quality and 6x multi-frame generation. Over 400 titles already support DLSS 4.5 and it will be available in GeForce driver update 591.74.",
