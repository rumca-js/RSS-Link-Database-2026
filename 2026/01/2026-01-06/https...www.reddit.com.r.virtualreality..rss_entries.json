You need a third party battery strap to fix the comfort (and battery life). A dedicated wi-fi 6 or better router for good PC wireless streaming and virtual desktop software. Steam Frame has all this included in the box.</p></li> <li><p>Stick drift is a big issue on most controllers. Either you live with the pain of it or you spend money on buying new controllers regularly, depending on how much you use it. My Quest controllers got stick drift after about 3 months of daily use. Steam Frame has magnetic sticks and will be much less susceptible to stick drift. And once they do eventually break you&#39;ll likely be able to easily replace the sticks yourself, just like the Steam Deck.</p></li> <li><p>Upgraded specs. Slightly better everything, inc",

(Nvidia control panel gave a stern warning against doing this though) Or maybe buying a HDMI dummy plug that pretends it&#39;s a 4K monitor? So that AC6 sees those and enable 4K.

I feel it&#39;s a circus of overselling and underselling.</p> <p>First. VR companies love to combine the resolution of both screens to make it sound higher than it is. Pimax did that to call the 8K an &quot;8K&quot; headset. I&#39;m sure some people backed it because they thought it would be 8K per eye. Remember when Atari did that with the Jaguar, and how people ridicule them for it now? Why is this any different? You couldn&#39;t do the math in 2018, and you certainly can&#39;t do the math in 2025. You couldn&#39;t even do it in 1993! By that standard, the original HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are 4K headsets.</p> <p>Second, I&#39;ve seen how people have called resolutions like 2160x2160 per eye &quot;2K&quot; per eye. That&#39;s the underselling I was referring to. I heard someone say the Steam Frame was going to be 2K per eye before it was revealed. I assumed that meant 1440p per e",
