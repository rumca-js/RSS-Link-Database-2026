        "description": "The Dakar Rally. It\u2019s the roughest, toughest and most brutal rally-raid on the planet. And now Defender wants in. \n\nSince its inaugural event in 1978, the Dakar Rally has worked hard to earn its reputation as the most gruelling off-road race in the world. Originally running from Paris to Dakar in Senegal, the off-road enduro now calls Saudi Arabia home. \n\nYou\u2019d think that the Dakar would be meat and potatoes for a brand like Defender. But 2026 is the first time that Defender has officially competed - and the company seems to be taking it very, very seriously with the most hardcore Defender 110 on the planet. It\u2019s called the Defender Dakar D7X-R and its competing in the revised \u2018Stock\u2019 category - basically for vehicles lifted from the production line and with standard engines, gearboxes, drivelines, bodywork and chassis. \n\nThe class that\u2019s a real test of a car that you can actually drive down a high street. Admittedly Defender\u2019s base car is the already pretty insane 4.4-litre V8 Defend",
