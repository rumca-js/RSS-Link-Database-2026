While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1\\% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is going to be a long rant. It started off as a reply to a comment of a person saying that AI in the music industry used to create music is the same as a human artist influenced by others creating their own music. What started off as a small reply, has evolved and grown to a multi-point essay detailing the differences of human nature vs machine and where do we go from here? The TLDR is that no, an artist and AI are not fundamentally the same, although I\u2019m sure those continuing to read are looking for more. </p> <p>One of the core conclusions that I have resolved to is that AI simply can\u2019t ever create something inspiring or invoke a sense of wonder. What I mean is, Michael Jackson (for example) changed the pop world in the 80s and his effect is felt today in artists like Bruno Mars. Eddie Van Halen inspired generations of guitar players to shred and push the boundaries of what can be achieved humanly on guitar. Jimi Hendrix inspired guitar players",

At the moment, modern science doesn\u2019t know what consciousness is, where it is located, how it arises, or how it operates. There are many theories about it, including 5 mainstream theories, but still it is just an unconfirmed theory. Humanity can\u2019t recreate, can\u2019t copy, and can\u2019t even describe what consciousness is. AGI must outperform every human on the planet in every professional area, including science, high art, and invention. So AGI must think out of the box, must be beyond the current limits of the training data, and must be able to invent and create truly new things, to solve great scientific problems. That is why consciousness is the must option, otherwise a 10\u201315\u2011year\u2011old teenager can outperform any fake AGI (which the top AI companies will try to sell us to justify billions of investments into nowhere).</p> <p>Don\u2019t be mistaken: if you really understand something about consciousness and can t",
