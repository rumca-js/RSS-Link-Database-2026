I did the best I could from the recommendations I received and updated my resume and made a cover letter explaining the situation/resume. </p> <p>I condensed everything into 1 page and tried to add the most important things I have done in each position instead of listing duties. </p> <p>So, I plan on applying for more positions tomorrow and wanted to see if anyone had any advice on the new versions I created. I saved everything everyone mentioned and will use the advice when I start applying so thanks again! Again, I have not made a resume in many years so I may still be way off with this one, but my hops are that I get closer and closer to landing ANY position lol.</p> <p>Here is the updated resume with a cover letter for review and thanks again for all that have helped me and given me motivation to keep grinding:</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/B6zq6Ap\">https://imgur.com/",
