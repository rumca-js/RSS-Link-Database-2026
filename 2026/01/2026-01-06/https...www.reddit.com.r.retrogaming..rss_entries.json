I don&#39;t have any games to test it but the red light doesn&#39;t come on and I was just wondering if it&#39;s supposed to turn on without a game? I bought a third party adapter that fits in the console perfectly and I did a good amount of research and it&#39;s the right specs and all so I would be surprised if it was the adapter. Anyway if anyone could confirm if my SFC is busted or not would be cool lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Such_Look_5063\"> /u/Such_Look_5063 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q5wijf/super_famicom_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q5wijf/super_famicom_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Tried the first cable, tv didnt recognize the source, then the same result with the second cable. I thought dang, there is no way I was shipped 2 dud cables. Plugged the s-video into my retrotink and then to the tv via hdmi... works perfect. So I know it&#39;s not an issue with the cables.</p> <p>Has anyone else ran into something similar? It makes no sense that this tv does not recognize this input. AV2 is a shared composite / S-video input, and it recognizes the composite jacks with no issue on the same consoles. I&#39;ve read the manual, it was no help.
