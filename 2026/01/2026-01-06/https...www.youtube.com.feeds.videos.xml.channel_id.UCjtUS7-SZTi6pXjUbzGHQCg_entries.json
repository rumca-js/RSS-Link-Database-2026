What if medical sensors could detect diseases years earlier than they do today? Graphene was supposed to deliver all of this and more. Since 2004, researchers called it a wonder material. It would revolutionize everything. 20 years later? Most of those promises fell flat. But now graphene supercapacitors are powering AI data centers. Graphene-enhanced concrete is being poured at industrial sites. Medical sensors using graphene are hitting the market. The trickle is turning into a flood. So what changed? How did graphene go from miracle material to overhyped curiosity to actually delivering results? And more importantly, how wil",
