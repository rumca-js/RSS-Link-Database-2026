Powered by light and equipped with tiny computers, the robots swim by manipulating electric fields rather than using moving parts. They can detect temperature changes, follow programmed paths, and even work together in groups. The breakthrough marks the first truly autonomous robots at this microscopic scale.",

Their findings show that certain experimental compounds can amplify pain relief without intensifying dangerous side effects like suppressed breathing. This research offers a fresh blueprint for designing opioids that last longer, work better, and pose fewer risks. It also opens doors to safer treatments for other brain disorders.",

Researchers found that inflammation in the brain disrupts the energy supply of vital movement-controlling neurons. As their mitochondria fail, these cells weaken and eventually die, worsening motor problems over time. Protecting brain energy systems could open the door to slowing these symptoms.",

The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum communication and computing.",

That makes this discovery especially promising for rapid clinical translation.",

Ocean sensors confirmed the quake\u2019s rupture was longer than earlier models suggested. Together, the findings could reshape how tsunamis are modeled and predicted.",
