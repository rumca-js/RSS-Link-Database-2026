Recently, I shared a feature idea with OpenAI through their official support channel, and it was confirmed that the suggestion was forwarded internally. I wanted to also share the idea here to hear honest feedback from the community.</p> <p>The core idea is a built-in ChatGPT Image Creation Contest inside the platform. Paid users would be able to submit images created using ChatGPT. Free users would be able to browse entries and vote. Only images generated within ChatGPT would be allowed, and weekly winners would be selected based on voting.</p> <p>Regarding the rewards concept, for free users, voting once per day would unlock a time-limited Pro-level experience. This could include temporary access to stronger models or higher-quality image generation. The goal is to let users experience premium features naturally, without pressure.</p> <p>For paid users,",
