A few things I am worried about however for the next 2(?) books and some things I would like to discuss:</p> <p>1, Do you think Norrigal and Kinch will reunite at some point, or at the end of the story? He did say he will do whatever he can to go back to her after he is done deciphering this book, and they were clearly in love, but maybe she will never be Norrigal again -she will take the place of Deadlegs-, or he will fail to find her? Deadlegs did mention he won&#39;t see her soon, or maybe never, and around the chapter where they had their moon wedding, his future narrator self did make a comment about him wishing he could see her again, which kind of points tow",

Later on I realized I mistook veteran experience for brilliance. This could have been a really great stand alone but instead we got a series that I am not really interested in exploring further. The world building is shallow and I straight up didn\u2019t understand how magic works and who was able to do what kind of magic tricks. Despite the author being an experienced crime novelist, the crime mystery here was bad and the big reveal Scooby-Doo-ish. Seriously, this \u201etwist\u201c has been overdone to death now. Also, in hindsight the prologue doesn\u2019t make much sense and I don\u2019t understand the cartoonishly evil villains motivation. Even after finishing I don\u2019t get how Ruko was able to do this what he did without him being absolutely rotten inside. His character development wasn\u2019t convincing.</p> <p>Still, 3.5/5. </p> </div><!-- SC",

For context: I think what I liked about these books where the themes of fighting against opression (in the books it were more about gender/colonialism) and the realistic setting of the real world (I liked being able to point out real life events/searching about them), but also how the magic bleeds trough it in a subtle way.

My wife reads, but she primarily is in the Lucy Foley-verse and similar novels to that. A big &quot;beach read&quot; gal, if you will. I&#39;ve tried to recommend her some stuff but nothing sticks. She started Tainted Cup, which I thought she&#39;d enjoy due to the mystery components, but I think it may have had too many fantasy elements for someone who doesn&#39;t have a lot of experience with the genre. She&#39;s not big into romance as the focal point of the book (which separates this from the other wife recommendation post) but wouldn&#39;t shy away if there were romance elements involved. She&#39;s been a fan of GoT, House of the Dragon, zombie shows, and she liked watching me play God of War. She&#39;s got a hard stop at sci-fi; for whatever reason she just can&#39;t get into anything futuristic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",

For example what I was always wondering throughout book 2 was when Rawain will enter and reclaim all Arin has lost, when will he take back power to ensure not even his son fails him?

Some highlights:</p> <p>I started the year with a complete re-read of Ben Aaronovitch&#39;s Rivers of London series, in their internal chronological order. Still a very entertaining time, and I was impressed yet again at how well the author keeps so many plot strands coherently in progress over a long series.</p> <p>Another re-read, Andre Norton&#39;s Murdoc Jern duology, <em>The Zero Stone</em> and <em>Uncharted Stars</em>. Classic space action and adventure, an old favourite that I&#39;ve re-read many times since I first encountered them as a teenager.</p> <p><em>Some Desperate Glory</em> by Emily Tesh. Brilliant space opera with modern sensibilities. Highly recommended, and it thoroughly deserved its Hugo.</p> <p>Hailey Piper&#39;s Tyrant Worm trilogy. Lovecraftian horrors, time travel, disaster lesbians, and a heel face turn by a velociraptor. What&#39;s not to like?</p> <p><em>A Drop of Corrup",
