In this lightning talk, Diego Rodriguez-Losada challenges the growing pressure to adopt static typing in Python. With a decade of experience maintaining a critical, widely-used, mostly untyped Python project, Diego shares why static typing might not be the best choice for every developer or codebase.\n\nTyping is often promoted as a way to catch bugs and improve code clarity, but is that always true? What about tools like mypy? Are type annotations helping readers or writers? What if Python typing starts to look more like Rust or Kotlin without offering their benefits?\n\nThis talk explores dynamic vs static typing, the value (and tradeoffs) of Python type annotations, and why developers should be free to choose what works for them\u2014without stigma. Diego offers an honest, experience-based critique ",
