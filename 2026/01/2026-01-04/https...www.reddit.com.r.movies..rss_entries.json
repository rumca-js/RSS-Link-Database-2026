(preferably pre-Covid back when everybody was normal, happy and enjoyed life)</p> <p>Mine was actually How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). I remember that movie was so big at the time and I ended up going (not intentionally) like 4 times in the same month. My friends wanted to see it, then I went with family, then I went with my cousins or something. But overall I watched it like 4 times. One time I had to sit in the front row, was forced to do it, because of how many people were there. Never sat in the front row again lol.</p> <p>In hindsight though it was a really unique experience because it was my own personal phenomenon. That was like peak Carrey too ... Miss his movies ...

I\u2019m not all that familiar with Wim Wenders\u2019 work - I\u2019ve watched and really like Paris, Texas but haven\u2019t seen anything else by him. Perfect Days seemed right up my alley though - a slow-burn slice of life film based in Tokyo, so I decided to check it out.</p> <p>It really is a very restrained and low-key story, even moreso than Paris, Texas, but it has a way of creeping up on you. I\u2019m finding that as much as I enjoyed it when I initially watched it, Im starting to appreciate it more afterwards as various scenes keep creeping up on my head. </p> <p>What really stands out to me is that I found the story simultaneously uplifting and sad.

The movie has a very cold, dark vibe and never tries to make you feel comfortable. It slowly pulls you into a world where ambition matters more than morality. Jake (Lou Bloom) really got under my skin. He\u2019s obsessive, manipulative, and feels completely empty inside. The moment he lets his partner die just to get exclusive footage genuinely made me angry, which says a lot about how effective the film is. Jake Gyllenhaal was incredible. The calm way he plays Lou, the forced smiles, and the lack of empathy feel disturbingly real. I hated the character, but I have a lot of respect for the performance. It\u2019s not a fun watch at all, but it\u2019s a powerful and uncomfortable one.

For example, She&#39;s out my league is a very run of mill rom-com. The only thing that it does different is the hot girl falls in love with the nerdy nice guy, and he spends the whole movie trying to wrap his head around it. Another example is the Roundup series of films which is pretty much the Korean Lethal Weapon but instead of shootouts and things blowing up it is Ma Dong Seok who is pretty much Sammo Hung if he was an MMA fighter built like a brick house knocking out fools in the name of justice. None of these films are groundbreaking but are well rounded, well-made and the actors gave it their best while respecting the viewer.

I know in the original release and on VHS and old DVD releases, Yoda was still a puppet until Episode 2, where the puppet was replaced with CGI for then on and also with the 2011 re-release</p> <p>But it got me thinking on whether it would&#39;ve been possible for Yoda to remain a puppet for the rest of the prequel trilogy? I know it would have been a challenge and yes, for some of the fight scenes, CGI would have to been use, but I wish George still went with the puppet for scenes to do not involved fighting. I just like the practical stuff. Though, I think George really wanted Yoda to be CGI for the Prequels.</p> <p>Regardless, Do you think Yoda should&#39;ve still been a puppet for Episode 2 and 3 or Star Wars?
