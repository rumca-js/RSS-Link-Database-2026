Well, recently i stumbled upon this one guy on tinder and we matched. I asked him on a date and i was super excited so i told my parents. Of course they started asking questions and i mentioned that hes a trans man. I didnt think much of it since he had that on his tinder profile so i assumed that its not like a secret but i probably shouldnt have. I also consider myself as a genderqueer even tho i pass as cis/dont really care how im gendered, and its something that i dont mind telling people if they ask or others mentioning it. I dont really feel the need to tell people about it (and i also did set my gender as a woman on tinder so he doesnt know). But im very aware that not everyone feels the same way especially since how i feel about my gender is just &quot;idgaf&quot;, and now i feel bad. Especially since my parents started ask",

I really enjoy playing the mobile game BitLife and I like the aspects they\u2019ve added for gender and sexuality but one thing sorta bugs me. When playing a transgender character and if you look at the character stats it says their gender \u201ctranssexual man or women. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s an outdated term but I\u2019m not sure.
