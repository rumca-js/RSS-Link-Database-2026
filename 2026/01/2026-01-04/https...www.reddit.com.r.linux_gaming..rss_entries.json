This lets friends or my girlfriend connect from other PCs/phones/tablets/TVs via <strong>Moonlight</strong>, effectively sharing my PC\u2019s hardware to create a kind of LAN party setup.</p> <p>The most common scenario is: I start Duo, my girlfriend connects through Moonlight on her laptop, and we both play our own games at the same time on the same machine. Her laptop isn\u2019t powerful enough to run even <em>The Sims</em> properly, so this setup works great for us.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a similar solution for Linux?</p> <p>I\u2019ve looked into this in the past but couldn\u2019t find anything tha",

I just switched to Pop OS today and so far it&#39;s been great.</p> <p>However I am not able to run any Steam games.</p> <p>So what I did was my games are in a separate drive from the OS. Steam is in my OS NVME drive which the Steam games are on an existing directory in another drive and I had my Steam on Pop OS read that directory. It did read the game files however the games are not running.</p> <p>Is it a good idea to uninstall and reinstall these games so it&#39;ll install as something readable by Linux?

Bottles also allows entering Offline Mode, but during which it can&#39;t check for DXVK or Proton updates.</p> <p>What you do instead, is you have to manually edit Application Menu shortcuts to include <code>bwrap --unshare-net</code> at the end of Command-line arguments (aka &quot;Exec=&quot;) field, but before &quot;%u&quot; parameter (and install bwrap if your distro doesn&#39;t have it already, but it&#39;s most likely already installed, conveniently it comes with Flatpak).</p> <p>To automate this process, I made a script to batch-edit all Application Menu shortcuts that reference Bottles and use a prefix/bottle name containing &quot;offline&quot; word:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash DESKTOP_DIR=&quot;$HOME/",

I&#39;ve ran into an issue that appears to be a recent problem that I have not experienced before. I have fiber internet, and my PC is hardwired. My windows Install gets a much better download speed on steam than on linux. I figured this was just a hoi4 workshop thing, as it&#39;s where I first noticed it, but it was present when downloading soul hackers as well.</p> <p>I found a post here saying to disable http2 in the config file. It worked for about 30 seconds. </p> <p>I&#39;m using arch for a distro, with the native package from the repo. Windows is installed on the same hardware, on another drive that is identical hardware wise to my Linu",
