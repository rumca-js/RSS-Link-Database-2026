However, I never felt like I had good visibility into who was connecting or trying to access my domains and services.</p> <p>I recently switched to Pangolin (which uses Traefik as reverse proxy), but I still felt something was missing: a dedicated log parser with a dashboard (i\u2019ve also exposed some api\u2019s endpoint). Since I couldn&#39;t find exactly what I needed, I decided to build it myself.</p> <p>It&#39;s a log parser that, at the moment, can be used with:<br/> - Pangolin (really easy to configure with docker compose)<br/> - Traefik installations</p> <p>I am always looking for people who want to contribute or propose ideas for improvement.
