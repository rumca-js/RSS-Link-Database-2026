I can connect into my AMP game server control panel but when I spin up a arma reforger instance or any other game. When I try to connect inside of said game it keeps kicking me and disconnecting. I have done everything to fix this issue within what the knowledge base i have but now need some advice what to learn or research to fix this issue.

The goal is to make it easier for teams to run AI systems on their own infrastructure, with full control over data, scaling, and integrations. The backend is built on top of the Vercel AI SDK, so it should be fairly easy to extend it with domain-specific features. Please let me know what you think about the overall architecture, ease of deployment, security, and potential feature gaps. Leaving a star or sharing the project elsewhere would also be much appreciated in case you find it useful\ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fide",

I had an old x86 box lying around, so I wiped it, installed a minimal Linux setup, and ran Android on top of it mostly out of curiosity. The goal wasn\u2019t performance or benchmarks I just wanted something predictable. What surprised me is how much of the \u201csmart TV experience\u201d problems are software, not hardware. Boot is fast. UI doesn\u2019t stutter over time. No ads. No accounts. No background junk fighting the remote. It turns on and does what it\u2019s supposed to do. Before anyone says it: yes, ARM boxes are cheaper and more power efficient. Yes, DRM is still a limitation. Yes, this isn\u2019t something I\u2019d recommend to non-technical users. But separating the panel from the software changed how I look at TVs. Once the \u201csmart\u201d part stops being tied to vendor firmware, the screen itself suddenly feels like it could last a lot longer.

Proxmox on the main machine because I like breaking things without taking everything down at once. Most of the actual work happens in Docker though, Proxmox just keeps the mess contained.</p> <p>For automation, n8n is doing like 70 percent of the heavy lifting. Webhooks, scraping, syncing data between apps, triggering emails, posting stuff. I tried to like Zapier again recently and immediately closed the tab.

Right now I\u2019ve got a Gigabyte GA-Z97M-D3H with a 4th gen Intel CPU, cooler, and 12GB of DDR3 RAM. I think all I need to finish it is a case and a PSU. The issue is that finding a reliable PSU and case is turning out to be more expensive than I expected, while there are used mini PCs that are really cheap and have upgradeable DDR4 RAM and a newer CPU. Since I\u2019m still new to this, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth investing more in the older parts I already have or just going for a cheap mini PC that might be easier to work with.

But as I understand it, before all the learning and doing, we should make sure that our internet provider allows self-hosting. I am nearly giving up on the whole thing because our only provider option (apart from mobile broadband, which wouldn&#39;t work) is Tele2 and when I tried asking them if they allow self-hosting at home, no one knows what I&#39;m talking about, they keep sending me on to support and either I wait 30+ minutes and the call ends or it ends immediately. One of the customer support agents misunderstood me so much that I ended up with a new Tele 2 subscription. It has been really frustrating. </p> <p>I thought I would check if anyone here has experience with self-hosting at home in Sweden and can give advice about the internet provider dilemma. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sporadi",
