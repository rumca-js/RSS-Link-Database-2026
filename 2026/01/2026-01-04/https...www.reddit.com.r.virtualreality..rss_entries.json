My take is that they considered to go with OLEDoS (eMagin\u2019s \u201cSteam Boat\u201d 4k OLEDoS prototype). But the technology is not yet ready to provide sufficient brightness at a cost (yield) sufficient for a large market.

The Quest 3 is connected to WiFi 6E. No extra network traffic. Everything is supposed to be in perfectly ideal condition. However, I kept getting only &lt;50Mbps stable connection no matter what I did. The Quest 3 was even able to download from the Internet at higher rate than that. It did not make any sense. Tried a few different streaming software and it was all the same.</p> <p>Then I found a random comment on ALVR Wiki about not entangling the Ethernet cable with the power cable. Then I saw the poorly shielded 2m cat5e cable from the ISP was completely knotted together with the PC power cable. I lifted the cable away from the ground, and the bandwidth immediately improved. I later changed it to a 0.5m cat6A cable, and the bandwidth headroom jumped up to over 1500Mbps.</p> <p",
