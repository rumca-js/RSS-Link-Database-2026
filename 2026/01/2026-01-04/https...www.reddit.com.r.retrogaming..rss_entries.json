When I eventually tried again one of the newer titles, I was shocked by the change in controls (shooting with the right stick etc).</p> <p>Just recently, with the release of Tape to Tape on Steam and after having discovered the NHL 1994 mod, I started to spend more and more time playing the genre again.</p> <p>In case you are interested, I also made a video, but I\u2019d love to hear which games are your favourites (and on which system) and which ones are you still okaying to this day</p> <p>Take care</",

But looking at Amazon, there are thousands of products and I\u2019m quite confused! For example, I came across this kind of product and I have no idea if it&#39;s any good: <a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/\">https://amzn.eu/d/</a></p> <p>Anyway, could someone with a bit of expertise help me out or point me toward specific products (that don&#39;t cost a fortune)? Thanks a lot</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ikemen38\"> /u/ikemen38 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q3swh5/japanese_super_famicom_n64_in_europe_what_power/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1q3swh5/japanese_",
