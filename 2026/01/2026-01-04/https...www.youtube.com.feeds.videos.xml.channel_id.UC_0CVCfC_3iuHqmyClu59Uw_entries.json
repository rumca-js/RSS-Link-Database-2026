        "description": "MSI just dropped a new ultrawide OLED that\u2019s been at the top of my list to try: the MSI MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36. This is a 34\u201d 3440x1440 QHD QD-OLED with a 360Hz refresh rate, plus a bunch of new features that actually matter day-to-day\u2014OLED Care 3.0, AI Crosshair (adaptive color), HDR curve customization, and MSI\u2019s new Pure Black / Dark Armor coating designed to keep blacks looking deep under room lighting.\n\nLearn More Here: https://msi.gm/S730D3CF\n\nIn this first look, I unbox it, go over the design + ports, dig into the OSD/software, and test it in real games like Cyberpunk 2077 and a high-FPS racer to see how that 360Hz feels in motion. I also demo USB-C video + 90W power delivery with a handheld (and the built-in KVM) so you can run mouse + keyboard right through the monitor.\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\n\u2022    HDR Curve Customization has been renamed to Uniform Luminance\n\u2022    Pureblack + 3H Hardnes",
