I love them figuring out their feelings, telling their friends, and really love when they keep it a secret. Also yes smut, loving the smut.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, i love some spice i think it adds to the book but i absolutely hate it when there is JUST SPICE. i feel like most books are like this these days i cannot find a book where the characters experience deep love, and diverse emotions like nostalgia, angst, profound sadness, madness.

And it was so well written for a kids show. It didn&#39;t rely on cheap screamers like modern horror blockbusters, it truly generated an atmosphere of mystery, terror, and dread. You were more afraid of what you couldn&#39;t see than what you could actually see. And at the end you don&#39;t get the satisfaction of a resolution. The ending is as terrifying precisely because you know nothing was resolved, and probably nothing will be, but you don&#39;t see a closure like death or anything either.</p> <p>That&#39;s exactly the vibe I&#39;m looking for on a book right now.
