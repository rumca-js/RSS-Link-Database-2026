But for a first game, everything still feels like it\u2019s going really well ^^</p> <p>We\u2019ve met so many kind people along the way, had great conversations, and slowly a small but lovely community is forming around the game. That alone already makes this project feel worth it to me.</p> <p>Because of that, I\u2019m still releasing an artbook and a soundtrack DLC. Not because I expect big numbers, but because I care about this game and want to give it the best version of itself. It\u2019s our first finished project, and we put a lot of love into it.</p> <p>Thanks for all the",
