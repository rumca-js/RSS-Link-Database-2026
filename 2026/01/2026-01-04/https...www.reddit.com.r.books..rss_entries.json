Perhaps you discover something new every time you reread a novel. Or, you don&#39;t because rereading a book is never as good as the first time. Whatever your reasoning, please feel free to discuss it here.</p> <p>You can view previous FAQ threads <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/faq\">here</a> in our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/index\">wiki</a>.</p> <p>Thank you and enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator\"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q3n8dc/weekly_faq_thread_january_04_2026_why_do_youdont/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q3n8dc/weekly_faq_thread_january_04_2026_why_do_youdont/\">[comments]</a></span>",

From galaxies, stars, planets, neutron stars, supernovae, black holes, pulsars, red giants, and white dwarfs, to the beginnings of life in Earth\u2019s oceans and the evolution of human beings, Sagan touches upon almost every major theme of the universe and our existence within it.</p> <p>It is an informationally dense book, but you can\u2019t help catching the sense of wonder and excitement with which the author shares his knowledge. His enthusiasm for space and science is infectious, making even complex ideas feel alive and meaningful.</p> <p>I do wish I had read a more up-to-date version of the book, especially given how much our understanding of the universe has evolved since it was written. Still, Cosmos remains a must-read for any space aficionado. And even if you aren\u2019t one, this book will almost certainly awaken your curiosity about the cosmos and our p",

I think this is the prefect book to illustrate how absurd adult supremacy is. </p> <p>Adult supremacy is the idea that children are subordinate or inferior to adults. Because of this, adults have a right to subjugate children. Adult supremacy is one of the most unquestioned and pervasive forms of discrimination in our society. </p> <p>I think that &#39;Matilda&#39; does a wonderful job at showing how adult supremacy feels to a child. Your opinions, feelings and wellbeing are ignored. Often times you are subjected to violence and abuse because it&#39;s seen as an adult&#39;s right to treat you in whatever way they see fit.</p> <p>Miss Trunchbull in many ways is a personification of adult supremacy. She is so physically imposing and strict. She verbally and physically abuses children. She comes up with insane punishments for misdemeanours. Miss Trunchbull does all of this because a) she believes",
