        "description": "Donald Trump has issued a new threat against Venezuela, telling interim leader Delcy Rodr\u00edguez she will \"pay a very big price\u201d if she does not cooperate with the United States.   It follows the US attack on the country and seizure of its president Nicolas Maduro, who has been flown to New York to face drugs trafficking charges.\n\nMs Rodriguez, who served as vice-president under Mr Maduro, has publicly condemned the American operation, describing his capture as an atrocity and saying Venezuela will defend itself.   However Donald Trump said in a new interview:   \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d   \n\nHe had previously said that the US was going to \u201crun Venezuela\u201d for the time being and has repeatedly stated that the US plans to control the country\u2019s vast oil reserves. The Trump administration has made clear that it is ready to carry out a further attack on Venezuela and  has massed a large military presence in the region.",
