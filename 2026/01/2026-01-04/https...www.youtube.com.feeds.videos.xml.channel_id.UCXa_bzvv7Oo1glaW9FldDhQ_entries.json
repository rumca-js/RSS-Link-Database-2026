        "description": "As we look past 2025 to the year ahead, one of its upcoming releases has caught our eye. Paraglacial's Fatekeeper seems to be a dark fantasy RPG worth exploring, its gameplay showcase bringing many interesting reasons to like it to the table. From snarky, humorous exchanges between its protagonist and their talking rodent companion, to battles that seem to require both brains and brawn thanks to a refined combat system, this is a title whose world and setting are quite compelling. \n\nWith a lot of potential to be among the finest games of 2026, and one that brings a lot of charm and heart to its narrative, Fatekeeper is definitely worth keeping an eye on, and trying out when it hits early access next year.",
