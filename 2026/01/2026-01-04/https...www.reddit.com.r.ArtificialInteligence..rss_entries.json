The idea was simple on paper and complicated in reality: Could a human use AI as a thinking partner instead of an answer machine? Not to replace thinking. Not to optimize life into a checklist. Not to outsource meaning. I wanted a mirror. Something that reflects thoughts back at you, applies pressure, surfaces patterns, and helps ideas form without telling you what to believe. Parts of it worked. And parts of it genuinely hurt me. What it actually helped with To be fair, it did improve some things. I got faster at answering questions. I became extremely self-aware. I noticed my thought patterns, habits, emotional reactions, and assumptions with almost uncomfortable clarity. It was like suddenly seeing everything, everywhere, all at once in my own head.

Back then there was the comparisons to the past movies that made this movie not favorable but one were to rewatch this movie without watching any of the previous Robocop movies with this current AI world that we are now in, this remake is now becoming relevant and possibly favorable and creepy that AI could go in this direction. Its also known in the movie how humans must still have control of AI and its like that in the real world. AI was mentioned in this movie and is portrayed as the machine in Robocop yet he also have a human element that he also addresses.
