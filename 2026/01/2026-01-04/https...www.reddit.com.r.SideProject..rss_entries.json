The response was great, but the #1 request I got was, &quot;When is this coming to Windows?&quot;</p> <p>Today, I finally shipped the Windows version.</p> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> It&#39;s a side-docked HUD that sits on your desktop. It&#39;s designed to be an <strong>&quot;execution engine&quot;</strong> rather than a database. You don&#39;t organise complex projects inside it; you just lock in what you need to do <em>right now</em> to prevent getting overwhelmed.</p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Everything is driven by slash commands (like a terminal or Discord):</p> <ul> <li><code>/d 100 pushups</code> - Adds a daily goal.</li> <li><code>/lockin 60m</code> - Dims your app screen, hides everything else, and starts a focus timer.</li> ",

I usually land on old forums, confusing wikis, or I get spoiled while searching.</p> <p>The solution: MangaSwitch. You type the anime name, it gives you the exact chapter to resume reading. No ads, no fluff.</p> <p>The Tech Stack:</p> <p>Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router)</p> <p>Styling: Tailwind CSS</p> <p>Backend/DB: Supabase (for the mapping data)</p> <p>Deployment: Vercel</p> <p>Note: The UI is currently in French (my native language), but the anime names and chapter numbers are universal, so it works for everyone.
