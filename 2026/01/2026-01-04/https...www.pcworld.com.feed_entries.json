Every January, the industry descends upon Las Vegas to pull back the curtain on the products that will power the upcoming year. Not only will you gawk at massive walls of bleeding-edge OLED monitors and oddball demoes of all sorts of PC gear, but CES often serves as the grand reveal for new generations of processors \u2014 and the army of laptops you\u2019ll find them inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year is no different \u2014 but what <em>is </em>different is that for CES 2026, PCWorld\u2019s crack team of PC experts will be blogging about the gaudy sights and fresh new tech goodies live as we see them.

It\u2019s basically their answer to the long-running problem of ultra-light laptops feeling a little flimsy.

In theory, it should survive being tossed into a backpack way better than older Grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is also having a moment here (when is it not having a moment?).
