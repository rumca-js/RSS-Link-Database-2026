It had a built in system so that any video you clicked on would download on its own into the app and would be playable offline, it took stupidly quick to download too. The ads were quiet and not invasive at all. Also there was a comics and manga section?? which seems weird but I am very impressed they got that on there. A few times I read on it while listening to some music I had also saved on it. It probably sounds very very generic, and it was, it had the same yellow app profile picture the rest have.
