Stay fully informed on events around the world with Ground News.\n\nThe #1 most-wanted particle in physics is the graviton, a quantum of gravity. If physicists were to prove that gravitons exist, they would unambiguously prove that Einstein\u2019s theory is ultimately wrong and must be replaced by a more complete theory that gives quantum properties to space and time. In a recent paper, a physicist came up with an ingenious experiment that could prove that gravitons do exist. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://o",
