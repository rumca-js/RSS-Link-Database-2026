Some started saying that speed is, but speed alone means nothing for most users. The new thing these days that differentiates one startup from another is how trustworthy they are. So I believe that GRC professionals and SOC analysts as well as security minded devs will be in very high demand. Even with AI entering the security space, we need to remember that almost every threat, vulnerabilities and risks are human driven.

I have been applying to multiple job postings with little luck. I was grateful enough to hear back from one company, and even got to the final round with them for a security analyst position, unfortunately it didn&#39;t pan out as much as I really wanted it to. Since then, I really haven&#39;t been hearing back at all, so I figured why not post my resume here (anonymously) to see if there is anything that I&#39;m doing wrong, whether it be a lack of skills, or resume needs tweaking etc... For the most part, I&#39;m targeting security analyst/soc lvl 1 positions.
