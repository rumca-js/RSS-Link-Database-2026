Wayland aimed to solve specific issues from its predecessor, such as proper multi-monitor support with independent refresh rates. The problem is that we are now left with two deeply problematic projects. People avoid touching X11 because it is a legacy system that is incredibly difficult to work on. However, many also dislike Wayland because of its excruciatingly slow protocol development process. To some, myself included, using Wayland feels like a regression compared to X11 when it comes to basic features like window position restoration. Security concerns and ideological differences are often at play in these discussions.</p> <p>I think we can all conclude that X11 is dead and something must replace it. That is fine.
