Later that day, I added \u201812\u201d skillet\u2019 to a running shopping note I keep in Apple\u2019s native Notes app. I didn\u2019t talk about it, didn\u2019t Google it, and didn\u2019t do any research on cookware.</p> <p>Within 24 hours, my Instagram ads became heavily skillet-focused; Made In, Smithey, Our Place, Field Company, etc. I hadn\u2019t seen cookware ads in months prior.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen other posts where people report similar timing after writing things in Notes, and the common response is that Apple is very strict about privacy and doesn\u2019t sell or share Notes data. I\u2019m aware correlation does not equal causation, and I\u2019m not claiming Apple is secretly monetizing Notes content. That said, the timing felt specific enough that I\u2019m wondering what plausible mechanisms could explain this, ",
