The game quickly tilted due to the family dynamics:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Protectionism:</strong> Our hostess refused to use her Warlord ability against her own children&#39;s cheap buildings.</li> <li><strong>The Friendly Fire:</strong> When she suspected me of being the Warlord, she used the Assassin to stop me to protect those same buildings. Unfortunately, the actual Warlord was the joint character controlled by my wife and son.</li> <li><strong>The &quot;Mean&quot; Factor:</strong> As the Assassin, I targeted the Thief. It turned out to be the 7-year-old girl. She lost her turn; although she understood the rules, she was bummed out to be effectively removed from the round.</li> </ul> <p>To create a version that works better for mixed age g",

Absolute bangers that remind you why his name carries so much weight. But if I\u2019m being honest, for every great Knizia game there are a bunch that land squarely in the \u201cfine, I guess\u201d category. Not bad, just kind of there. His hit rate feels lower than his reputation sometimes suggests.</p> <p>That got me thinking about ratios, not total output, but great games versus meh ones. Knizia publishes a lot, so even a 10 percent hit rate still gives us classics. But are there designers right now with a better batting average?</p> <p>Bruno Cathala immediately comes to mind. He\u2019s prolific too, but his designs feel more consistently strong. Even his lighter or more commercial games tend to be clever and polished, and the outright duds feel rare. Another one I keep circling back to is Shem Phillips, the Garphill Games designer. His output is more focus",
