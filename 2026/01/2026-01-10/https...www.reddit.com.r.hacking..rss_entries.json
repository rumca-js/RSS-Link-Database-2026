I recently got a soulear ear camera as a ridiculously budget micro soldering camera. When I went to download the app that the camera uses, I saw that it was 100% definitely spyware. Thing is, I still want to use the camera if possible. Is there any way I could possibly use something like nmap to access the video feed? The camera uses its own WiFi network that the phone connects to.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lightningwolf_uwu\"> /u/lightningwolf_uwu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1q9j312/how_to_access_a_camera_feed_from_a_wifi_ear_camera/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1q9j312/how_to_access_a_camera_feed_from_a_wifi_ear_camera/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Used to do cisco shit. Anyway im finally teaching myself some modern programming languages and I got curious about some shit so I googled about femtocells, I was curious if the tech on Mr robot was real. Well fuck a duck that shits simple as all get out. I imagine reverse engineering things originally and writing the code took some work but the concept is simple as shit. Just thought id share my aha moment with some people who would get it. And yes, I know, illegal af dont do it, and dont tell us if you do. I got you fam.
