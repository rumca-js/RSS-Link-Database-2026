        "description": "#Timekettle #CES2026 #translationearbuds \n\nAt CES 2026, Timekettle showcased its approach to real-time translation, not as a feature demo, but as a live conversation.\n\nIn this video, I focus mainly on the W4 translation earbuds, including a real bilingual test where I speak English and a Timekettle representative responds in Chinese. Instead of stopping, tapping screens, or passing devices around, the goal here is simple: let the conversation flow naturally.\n\nI also take a quick look at Timekettle\u2019s other translation devices, including the W4 Pro earbuds and the T1 and X1 handheld translators, and where each of them makes the most sense.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Learn more about Timekettle:\nhttps://www.timekettle.co?utm_source=elfa&utm_medium=ceskol",
