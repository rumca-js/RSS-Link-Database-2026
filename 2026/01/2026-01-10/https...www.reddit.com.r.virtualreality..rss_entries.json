A system would include a cap with an eye mask that syncs with your brain directly while you physically lie down or recline comfortably. You\u2019re fully immersed in the game environment in every way; you walk, run, jump, climb, have sense of touch, feel a breeze, smell all the applicable smells. In every aspect, you feel like you\u2019re there. In FPS games you feel the recoil, heat on your face from explosions, smell the cordite, and of course a dulled sense of impact from bullet or fragments. In a flight simulator or driving game you feel the G-forces, that click of switches and buttons, etc. Theme Park and vacation games would be a hit for those not wanting the excitement. Team building, Leadership, mental wellness, and education sessions would be amazing! </p> <p>What\u2019s your take on the future of gaming?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",

So I only use virtual desktop for pcvr gaming on my quest 2, but the thing is: Should I wire my headphones to the quest 2 or to my pc? Idk if it makes more sense to wire them to the quest 2 because the latency should play them at the same time. </p> <p>Sorry if this is a dumb question lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LekovY\"> /u/LekovY </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1q8zg4m/question_about_audio_input_for_virtual_desktop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1q8zg4m/question_about_audio_input_for_virtual_desktop/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I am trying to run No Man&#39;s Sky and would love some help.</p> <p>A little background: I am a newbie tech hobbyist who built his PC several years ago. Notably, the graphics card I chose was a GeForce 1660 Super. I have 16gb RAM and a m.2 SSD (512gb I think? Let me know if that even matters). I tend to need tech stuff ELI5 and often miss the most obvious answers. As far as I&#39;m concerned, my PC runs the games I like great, but I have noticed that newer games need to run on standard graphics settings, if not lower.</p> <p>My desktop computer is on a wired connection, 300mbps download and 40 upload speed. </p> <p>My Q3 has VD installed and connected to my desktop. I can open No Man&#39;s Sky in VR just fine, but the graphics are awful and the stutter and lag make the game unplayable.</p> <p>The graphics in NMS are already set to the lowest settings.

Meaning that things shouldn&#39;t be heavily automated. Give me options to choose from. Use the full capability of VR and all of its inputs. I want parkour that I can feel and where I&#39;m not babied or the game is made worse for people with motion sickness. Every parkour game just feels stale at this point.</p> <p>This doesn&#39;t apply to just running around or &quot;parkour&quot; grappling hooks are other alternate ways of moving. Hell even gtag could be a good example of this. You get full control in that game and you can perform insane sht in it but personally I&#39;m not a fan of the movement gimic and playerbase.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MinkoManiac437\"> /u/MinkoManiac437 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1q8tgby/u",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, I\u2019m completely new to VR in general but it has been an area I\u2019ve been wanting to explore for a long time, I have a PC with 3070 TI that I\u2019ve had for a few years and a PS5. I used to love PC gaming with friends every single day for hours but now that I\u2019m working full time, I don\u2019t see myself having the time or energy on most days to sit at my desk to game for additional few hours when I spend most of the day sitting at a desk already. So I tend to only play on my PS5 in the comfort of my own bed or do media streaming to unwind before turning in for the night.</p> <p>Recently picked up interest and was thinking of pulling the trigger on getting a Quest 3 + a cheap upgraded strap for comfort as I\u2019ve read, but now I see that Steam Frame is set to release soon so I\u2019m contemplating if I should opt for that instead? Although the aspect of AR and XR in Q3 has been quite appealing as it amazes the child inside me. </p> <p>For context I live in Singapo",
