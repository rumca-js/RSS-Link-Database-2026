        "description": "NEW POSTER! https://totallynotmark.com/\n\nDragon Ball Daima was an incredible series that, for one reason or another, didn\u2019t fully connect with a wider audience. Despite that, it was filled with infectious charm and genuinely strong character writing, and principal writer Yuko Kakihara was clearly working under heavy constraints. In Part 2, we\u2019re taking another look at Daima and exploring what it could have been. With the help of some incredible artists, sound designers, and our friends over at Team Four Star, we\u2019ve been able to bring Act 1 to a close!\n\nCREDITS:\n\nWRITTEN & DIRECTED BY\n @TotallyNotMark & @AnimeAjay \n\nADDITIONAL WRITING BY\n@KaiserNeko \n\nART BY\nDRAFTSMAN79 - https://x.com/Draftsman79_\nCHRY_INSI_ART - https://www.instagram.com/chry_insi_art/\n\nADDITIONAL ART FROM DRAGON BALL DAIMA\n\nSOUND DESIGN BY\nARTISTE INCCONU\n\nMUSIC\nBombing Mission (Game Music Collective)\nFearsome Ginyu Forces (Android Orchestra)\nThe Monster Freeza VS SSJ Goku (Android Orchestra)\n\nVOICE CAST\n\n@MasakoX \n",
