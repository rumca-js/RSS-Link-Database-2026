It doesn't even clear the bar of being a successful clone of the various other third-person shooters it cribs most of its ideas from. Its dated map layouts and visual style let its predecessors down. The only weight I felt from its convoluted story and flat, empty characters were on my eyelids. Its anemic host of enemies are dull, and far more scary are the amount of bugs that were in this review build that, though a priority on developer TeamKill Media\u2019s list of fixes, hit Code Violet\u2019s balance and pacing like a life-ending comet from outer space.",

What did it take to make a show about a zombified version of Spear? And how much of our beloved caveman is still lurking inside that desiccated, hulking corpse? Watch the video to hear Tartakovsky's thoughts.\n\nWe also discuss what happened to Fang (Joel Valentine), the T-rex who became Spear's best friend, and whether or not she might return this season. Plus, whatever happened to the anthology version of Primal that was supposed to serve as Season 3? We've got all that and more, so watch the full interview!\n\n#IGN",
