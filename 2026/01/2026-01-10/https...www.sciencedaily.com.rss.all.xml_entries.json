        "description": "Scientists have identified a brand-new species of worm living in the Great Salt Lake, marking only the third known animal group able to survive its extreme salinity. The species, named Diplolaimelloides woaabi with guidance from Indigenous elders, appears to exist only in this lake. How it got there remains a mystery, with theories ranging from ancient oceans to birds transporting it across continents. The discovery could help scientists track the lake\u2019s health as conditions rapidly change.",

Scientists found that this \u201cepigenetic drift\u201d follows a clear pattern and appears in both aging intestines and most colon cancers. Some regions age faster than others, forming a patchwork of weakened tissue more prone to degeneration. Encouragingly, researchers showed this drift can be slowed\u2014and partly reversed\u2014by restoring iron levels or key cellular signals.",

Researchers analyzing nationwide data found that insufficient sleep was more closely tied to shorter life expectancy than diet, exercise, or loneliness. The connection was consistent year after year and across most U.S. states. The takeaway is simple but powerful: getting seven to nine hours of sleep may be one of the best things you can do for long-term health.",

Researchers have now uncovered a hidden three-part loop that fuels tumor growth, involving the cancer drivers SRSF1, AURKA, and MYC. By targeting just one part of this loop with a specially designed molecule, they were able to shut down all three at once. The result was a dramatic loss of tumor cell survival, offering new hope for smarter, more effective treatments.",
