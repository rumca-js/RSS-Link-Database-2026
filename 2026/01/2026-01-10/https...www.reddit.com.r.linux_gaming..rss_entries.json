It kicks me back to the launcher when i run it, just as the Easy Anticheat should kick in.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently ordered an RX 9070 as a replacement for my 7700XT. I found forums and videos from months ago saying that rasterization performance is pretty much up to par and just a tad bit slower than on Windows but that RT performance was pitiful. I couldn&#39;t find any recent resources on this so I wanted to inquire and see what people&#39;s experiences are using these cards on Linux. Are the Mesa drivers good on RDNA 4, or should I temper my expectations?
