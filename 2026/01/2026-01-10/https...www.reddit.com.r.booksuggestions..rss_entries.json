I got back into books through movies because I loved how peter Jackson portrayed the worlds in Lotr, King Kong, The hobbit (1st one is probably my favourite lotr movie) and Mortal engines which sadly flopped immensely. Game of thrones, House of the dragon and Harry Potter are also often rewatched by me. The portayel of scale and love to detail made me want to know more about the worlds. </p> <p>I read all 7 books of the mortal engines series before the movie came out after I saw the first teaser/trailer and have done so again probably 3 times by now. </p> <p>I read the hobbit at least 2 times by now and have not quite gotten through lotr a second time just yet because I&#39;ve been busy with t",

I would love it if you could suggest to me any books which have a strong mmc who is cold, rich, hot,posessive and morally grey or even black. The fmc should be strong aswell and NOT cringe or be too sunshiny. Enemies(PROPER enemies) to lovers, Mafia, arranged/forced marriage and brother&#39;s bsf tropes are just a chef&#39;s kiss. I don&#39;t want to read any which have a big age gap, workplace, disabilities, single parent, pregnancy. As much as I LOVE to read BL mangas/manhwa/webtoons i prefer reading my books with a straight mc. I die for jealousy scenes with both mmc and fmc. If it&#39;s a mafia book, then the girl should not be scared of blood and stuff. Also, if it&#39;s not a dark romance, then i would just love to read a nice",

I also love that this book tracks her struggles and how they played a role in her music. so yeah, I\u2019d like a memoir written by a songwriter that may offer wisdom to someone just getting into songwriting, but it is told in the form of a narrative of the author\u2019s life. thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BumblebeeMost3895\"> /u/BumblebeeMost3895 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q9hnk3/memoirs_on_songwritingby_songwriters/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q9hnk3/memoirs_on_songwritingby_songwriters/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This one is on my TBR, but I am a bit hesitant because I have heard it does not hit as hard, and I do not want to disappoint myself. So while I work up to it, I am looking for emotionally devastating reads. The kind that stay with you and maybe make you cry days later. I have already read most of the usual recommendations like A Little Life, Flowers for Algernon, A Thousand Splendid, etc. Please suggest books that emotionally wrecked you, or at least stayed with you for a long time.

Somehow I manage to have almost every major geological group represented <em>except</em> indigenous and native authors. </p> <p>I still remember when I first started intentionally buying books by black authors. I was in undergrad and realized &quot;wow, I don&#39;t have many books by black authors.&quot; I went to predominantly white schools and went to a predominantly white college, so I wasn&#39;t super exposed to authors of color other than Toni Morrison (who remains one of my fave black authors). After a year or so of that, I was like &quot;I should expand to asian authors.&quot; I started with east asain and eventually fell in love with a handful of southeast Asian authors, like Rin Chupeco. Then, I thought &quot;wait, what about Africa",

There does not necessarilly have to be a murder in the story...but mind games or puzzle games are must. (not squid game type games but more intelligent, academic (even secret history type dark academia), even horror are appreciated). It can be also sci-fi, supernatural or psychological, but please not like Alex Michaelides&#39;s like books where a supposedly supernatural element is reduced to psychological nonsense, with an entirely predictable ending. You can also recommend graphic novels, comics, mangas, animes, movies, tv seri",

By this I don\u2019t mean skepticism for its own sake, nor simply repeating what popular voices say, but the ability to form judgments responsibly rather than react emotionally, distinguish facts, interpretations, and moral evaluations navigate propaganda, bias, and social pressure (online and offline), think clearly without becoming cynical, arrogant, or tribal, integrate careful reasoning with humility, love, and biblical faith. My epistemic foundation is the Bible, so I\u2019m especially interested in authors within the Reformed / Calvinist / Anglican tradition, though I\u2019m open to others if they genuinely take Christian truth claims seriously. I\u2019m particularly interested in works that deal with epistemology and how Christians should understand knowledge and truth, discernment, prudence (phronesis)",

It wasn\u2019t pulling me in the same way.</p> <p>For Christmas I got a Kindle, and I started Happy Place by Emily Henry. I\u2019m only on chapter 2 (like page 6 or 7\u2014yes, it\u2019s that early and yes 6 7 I know we all probably hate that but that is where I think I am at), but I\u2019m really struggling to get into it. I can\u2019t seem to push past this point.</p> <p>I loved the emotional, addictive vibe of November 9, so I thought Emily Henry might be similar (contemporary romance, emotional depth, etc.).</p> <p>Is Happy Place worth pushing through?

I read a lot of Stephen King and other books in my teens, and think the most recent one I actually completed was Stranger in a Strange Land a couple years ago. I&#39;ve been trying to read 1984 lately, but I&#39;m terribly bored. I&#39;ll definitely get back to it, but for now I&#39;m in dire need of something more riveting.</p> <p>My favorite themes are the ones listed in the title, with The Expanse being my favorite TV series. I have the e-books, but think I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed with starting a series. I would instead like to get back into it with a stimulating single book within my theme range - any suggestions?</p> <p>Muchas thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Baconsaurus\"> /u/Baconsaurus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q8vs2p/alte",

I love reading webtoons but I love curling up with a good book so much more. I\u2019ve seen a few love triangle books but they\u2019re more dark romance and I wasn\u2019t really interested in that. I more enjoy the cute and quirky kind of story lines. Any ideas? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Think_Macaroon5883\"> /u/Think_Macaroon5883 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q8snpx/any_ideas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q8snpx/any_ideas/\">[comments]</a></span>",
