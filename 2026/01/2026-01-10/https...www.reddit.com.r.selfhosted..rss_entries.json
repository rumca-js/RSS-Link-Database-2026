I will be exposing nextcloud and authentik for sure, as well as immich and jellyfin later if tailscale is not to my liking.</p> <p>I got myself an n150 16gb opnsense device. I will be running a crowdsec bouncer on it for sure. It will also come in handy when isolating my server.</p> <p>Now... When I search for protection tools on opnsense devices, i often read &quot;Run suricata on WAN and zenarmor on LAN&quot;.</p> <p>If i run suricata on WAN, I assume it will only scan encrypted https data (I will only have port 443 opened). If suricata cannot see the data, then what&#39;s the point?</p> <p>And for those running zenarmor on LAN, are you using the free version? And what protection does it offer that suricata and crowdsec doesn&#39;t?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/XxTriviumxX\"> /u/XxTriviumxX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

I have a Proxmox cluster running in my local network and am currently running everything off my ISP\u2019s modem/router. I did order myself brand-new rack equipment to redo all my networking (UDM Pro with a couple of UniFi APs), so I probably will use their built-in protection stuff. I believe I saw something like that. For now, I\u2019d like to run something on my cluster that monitors everything. I\u2019m already running Wazuh, but I\u2019d love to have more insight into my network because some devices on my network can\u2019t be trusted at all. Everything\u2019s already subnetted and separated, but it does feel nice to have everything monitored ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlessioDam\"> /u/AlessioDam </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1q946zp/idsips/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",

For example, I never really purchase too many albums, but mostly singles that I liked. Then I would rename the artist and album to something like &quot;80&#39;s Mix&quot;, I did this because it just seemed to make sense to me 20 years ago when I would listen to my music on an ipod. </p> <p>Fast forward to today, I realized how wrong I was to do this. I discovered MusicBee, which is amazing, I fixed the tags, learned how it structures the library and how to have the file system reflect that.
