Physical AI is no longer experimental \u2014 it\u2019s shipping in production vehicles, robots trained entirely in simulation, and agentic AI systems operating without step-by-step instruction.\n\n* The biggest shift:*  context memory is no longer the bottleneck. AI systems can now retain full decision histories locally. The constraint has moved from memory to agency.\n\n* CES 2026 highlights from NVIDIA:* \n\u2022 Level 3 autonomy scaling globally by 2026\n\u2022 Multi-model agent routing replacing monolithic stacks\n\u2022 Open-source foundation models enabling national and industry AI\n\u2022 Agentic systems planning and executing end-to-end\n\nHundreds of billions are already in motion. The companies moving now will define the next decade of industrial AI.\n\nWhat NVIDIA announcement shocked yo",
