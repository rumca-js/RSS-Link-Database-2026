I recently read &quot;The Secret History&quot; and loved how <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Richard is an unreliable narrator</span>.</p> <p>So, with that in mind, I&#39;d love to hear recommendations for fantasy books that deal with an interesting political environment the mc has to navigate.

I love that Ana is a female character who is grotesque and weird but still compassionate and valued, and that Din is coming to feel close to her.

All the way from Oliver Twist, series of unfortunate events up to ASOIAF. I feel like in adult fantasy I rarely see young children as MCs. Aryra\u2019s story is one of my favorite things in ASOIAF, her trying to survive the worst situations with people stronger and bigger than her all with just her wits and cunning. There is something very unique about having a child POV in a large, uncaring world that hit differently then any other type of pov. So any good examples of in modern fantasy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ginger6616\"> /u/ginger6616 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1q8xqt1/nonkid_fantasy_series_with_children_mcs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1q8xqt1/nonkid_fantasy_series_with_children_mcs/\">[comments]</a></span>",
