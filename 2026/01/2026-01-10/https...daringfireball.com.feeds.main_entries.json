The fact that it hasn\u2019t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley\u2019s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lopatto\u2019s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google\u2009\u2014\u2009and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies\u2009\u2014\u2009are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It\u2019s",
