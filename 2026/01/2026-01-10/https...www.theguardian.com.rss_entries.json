This was a controlled, clinical performance from Liam Rosenior\u2019s second string, who strolled into the fourth round of the FA Cup after a 5-1 win over a game but limited Charlton Athletic, but once again the big talking point was the travelling support spewing venom in the direction of their unpopular owners.</p><p>Dissatisfaction with the project is not going away. It did not even matter when Rosenior looked at his bench with Chelsea 3-1 up in the second half and decided to give Estev\u00e3o Willian a runout against tired, lowly Championship opposition. The Brazilian winger is one of the best young players in the world and his runs were soon making Charlton\u2019s defenders dizzy, but even signings like Estev\u00e3o have done little to sway the view of a fanbase united in opposition to an ownership almost four years in and still to convince naysayers that ",

The 41-year-old American\u2019s second success and fourth podium from four downhills this season increased the veteran skier\u2019s lead in the standings and cemented her favourite status for next month\u2019s Winter Olympics.</p><p>Already the oldest World Cup winner of all time, Vonn was fastest by 0.37sec from Norway\u2019s Kajsa Vickhoff Lie with a run of 1min 06.24sec on a cold and cloudy morning with snow falling in Zauchensee, Austria. Another American, Jacqueline Wiles, completed the podium, 0.48 slower than Vonn, on a piste considerably shortened after Friday\u2019s training was cancelled due to heavy snowfall.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/10/lindsey-vonn-seals-olympic-favourite-status-with-fourth-podium-in-",

Anders Hillborg took the principle as inspiration for his composition Exquisite Corpse but, where the surrealists hoped for signs of an unconscious collective sensibility, the emerging components of Hillborg\u2019s piece bear his consciously singular imprint while also incorporating references to composers as disparate as Stravinsky, Ligeti and Sibelius.</p><p>In the performance given by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales",

A second necessary tool in the month of January is the ability to dispose of or transform a swede into an evening meal. For the uninitiated, when roasted, the swede, that pretty, purple-creamed, dense little ball, is part-creamy, part carrot-like in nature, and earthy and sweet in flavour. It also takes to big-flavoured sauces such as this tomato, ginger and coconut curry like a chip to vinegar and couples up well with its seasonal pal, fresh, crunchy purple sprouting broccoli.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2026/jan/10/vegan-roast-swede-purple-sprouting-broccoli-curry-recipe-meera-sodha\">Continue reading...</a>",
