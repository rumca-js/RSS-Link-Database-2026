Use my code \"Sabine25\" and go to https://www.getrecall.ai/?t=sabine for 25% off a Recall subscription that is valid during January.\n\nA unified theory \u2013 that explains the interactions in the standard model of particle physics from one common origin \u2013 has been a goal of physicists ever since the completion of the standard model. But according to a recently published paper which analyzed the properties of the laws of nature in a multiverse, a unified theory might be incompatible with the presence of life in our universe. Let\u2019s take a look at both of these ideas and why they might be incompatible.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08220\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newslet",
