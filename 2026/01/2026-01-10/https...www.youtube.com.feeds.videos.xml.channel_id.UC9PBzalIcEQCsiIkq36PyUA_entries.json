Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nWhen we moved from CRT to LCD, gaming lost something of crucial importance: motion stability, motion clarity. Even today's monitors exhibit motion blur, especially evident with strong lateral movement. Backlight strobing, black frame insertion and other methods have sought to mitigate the problem - but all have their drawbacks. Enter Nvidia G-Sync Pulsar - 4x motion clarity over standard LCD with full VRR support. While not quite perfect, it's a genuine game-changer as John and Rich discuss.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n02:56 - What is Pulsar?\n04:49 - Prior Solutions\n06:40 - Smooth at lower frame-rates\n09:33 - The 60Hz situation\n14:10 - What is this Monitor?\n19:01 - Easy to Use!\n22:49 - Ending",
