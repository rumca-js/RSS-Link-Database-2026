So if you only owned the cartridge but lost everything else, you could try to buy the original box, manual, and poster for cheaper, and then turn around and flip the whole package for $270 USD (ie. if you could buy a good condition box, manual, and poster for under $100 USD, you should do that and combine it with your cartridge to sell the whole thing for over $270 USD).</p> <p>Original boxes are worth so much these days, it&#39;s s",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>With things like the Final Fantasy pixel remasters, sonic origins and the megaman legacy collection, the original games ran at 240p. But when playing the remasters on something like the PS4 or Switch they run at 1080p. This means the pixel art is scaled up by a factor of 4.5. Does this not result in the games looking muddy because all the pixels end up being stretched. This isn&#39;t a problem when playing at 1080p or 4K as it scales evenly (by a factor of 6 and 9 respectively). Do the remasters have a method to work around this and keep the true image intact?</p> <p>I am just talking about remasters. I know that it looks bad when playing on original hardware at 1080p. The issue is the remasters do actually run at 1080p, I just want to know how that works with the pixel art.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HpyeGolde\"> /u/HpyeGolde </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comm",
