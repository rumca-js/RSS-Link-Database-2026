        "description": "Pathologic 3 is a much better follow-up, and perhaps the best game in the series for fans to get into. While leaning on survival horror, the psychological aspects go far deeper, and trying to save the town alongside unravelling the core mystery, which presents its fair number of shocks, can be as disorienting as it is addictive. \n\nJust remember to stay patient throughout and value the lives of those around you, endlessly complex as they may be.",

        "description": "Anthem will be dead and buried in a few days, and will join numerous other live service games that squandered their potential. The truth is that the game, despite having some really good parts, didn\u2019t do much above the required minimum. And simply put, that is not enough. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame that, for most of us, Anthem won\u2019t be remembered as a game worth our money or our time; rather, it\u2019ll stand as a reminder of how poor management, weak planning, and troubled development can doom a game in a matter of weeks.",

        "description": "The Resident Evil series has always been a source of scares for its players. The Umbrella Corporation\u2019s careless experimentation into Bio-Organic Weapons (or BOWs, as we call them) has given the studio the scope to create some truly terrifying concepts, designs, and creatures for us to discover as we made our way through a long list of great games in the franchise. \n\nBut some of the places we've been to along the way have managed to stay with us long after we rolled the credits on the game that hosted them. Be it the environments, the general anticipation of another horror waiting around a corner, or a multitude of vicious creatures waiting to rip us to shreds, there are locations in several Resident Evil games that come to mind when we think of how scary titles in the franchise could be.",
