Explore the open-source release today: https://ltx.io/model\n\nI thought this week would be quiet before CES\u2026 and then AI companies decided to go wild anyway. In this video, I\u2019m breaking down the biggest drops you may have missed, including ChatGPT\u2019s first real move into health, Google sneaking AI deeper into Gmail and Docs, and a whole wave of new AR wearables starting to hit the market.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at a brand-new burst of models from Meta, Mistral, AWS and more. Some of this feels like a preview of what\u2019s coming at CES next week, and some of it came out of nowhere.\n\nIf you want a clean, fast catch-up before the chaos hits, this is the one to watch.\n\n#AI #ChatGPT #TechNews #AR #Wearables #FutureTools\n\nDiscover More:\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Explore AI Tools & News: https://futuretools.io/\n\ud83d\udcf0 Weekly Newsletter: https://futuretools.io/newsletter\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f The Next Wave Podcast: https://youtube.com/@TheNextWavePod\n\nSocials:\n\u274c Twiter/X: https://x.com/mreflow\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Instagr",
