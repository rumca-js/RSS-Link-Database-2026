The data was stored on a DuckDB, I was given a small city until I had my permissions accepted and generated with DataBricks which is where the data was stored. The fact that my permissions took that long to generate meant that in my limited internship, I was going to face drawbacks and slow-downs, just because of the way the data was stored and setup.

I looked into using the official API, but the free tier is extremely limited, and the paid tiers are pricey for a one-off cleanup.</p> <p>So, I decided to build a client-side Chrome Extension to do it via DOM manipulation instead. Here is how I approached it:</p> <p>The Architecture:</p> <p>I went with a simple Manifest V3 extension. \u2022 Popup: Simple HTML/CSS interface to select what to delete (Posts, Replies, or Reposts).</p> <p>\u2022 Content Script: This is where the magic happens. It injects into the active tab and interacts with the page elements directly.</p> <p>The Challenge: DOM Selectors</p> <p>X uses React Native for Web, so the class names are a mess of obfuscated strings (e.g., css-175oi2r). Instead of relying on brittle classes, I had to use more specific selectors (like aria-label attributes and SVG paths) to identify the &quot;More&quot; menu and the &quot;Delete&quot;",

Create boxes, scan cards in, and print QR codes to put on your physical boxes. Scanning them shows you the contents of the box. </p> <p>Have a friend you want to show your collection off to? Not a problem, each box has a public url tied to it that you can share and show off. </p> <p>Need to provide documentation to insurance?
