So I&#39;ve switched to linux over 6 months ago now, and have been enjoying it, at least compared to windows for development, it&#39;s sooo good. Problem is, usually when i want to do something i don&#39;t actually know <em>how</em> to do it, i know what i want to do, but i don&#39;t know the commands, the UNIX philosophy, etc. </p> <p>Most of the time i relied on ai writing all of the commands for me, but that doesn&#39;t seem right. I guess i learned a little while i was at it, but only a tiny fraction to all there is to linux. </p> <p>I have started reading a book about linux once, unfortunately it was written in like 2010&#39;s when even <code>systemd</code> wasn&#39;t around, so I&#39;d say it was pretty old. </p> <p>The question is, anyone has learning resources i may wanna checkout? Preferably something free and what i can do at home.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NeKon69\"> /u/NeKo",
