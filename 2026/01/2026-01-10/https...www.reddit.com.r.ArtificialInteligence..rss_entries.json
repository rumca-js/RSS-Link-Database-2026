        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ok here&#39;s the deal.</p> <p>I have a very small and humble Youtube channel, but still I have my small circle of viewers and I want to keep making videos. </p> <p>I have no problem with the script and the recording that I can do. But it gets really hard to make the editing specially when I review very big franchises. I do not monetize the channel and can only make this in my spare time. </p> <p>So I wonder, is there a program that can help me with that? For example if I want to make a video named &quot;All Indiana Jones Movies Reviewed&quot; can I tell it (preferably based on the script tho not mandatory) to make an edit of it, like adding clips according to the summary of each film?</p> <p>Thanks in adavance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Luppercus\"> /u/Luppercus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1q8rmgr/recommendations_for_possible_video_editin",
