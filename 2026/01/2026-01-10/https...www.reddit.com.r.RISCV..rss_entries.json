        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a milk-v Jupiter single board(M1 cpu, 16gb of ram). It has a system supported by the manufacturer(bianbu \u2013 a modified version of ubuntu), so it must work just fine. However, when I connect the power supply and the hdmi cable, my screen remains black(it sees some signal, but does not display anything). The cpu on the board is heating up, so the power should be alright. I also have a keyboard and a mouse connected via USB receivers, but they don&#39;t show any signs of life. I use an SD card for the os(it is pretty old and slow, but still is perfectly functional) and a 12V power supply. My monitor is 2K, 144hz. I have already had problems with displaying thing on it, but usually a nomodeset parameter would solve them. Can I apply this parameter on a risc-v system as well? Thanks in advance! P.S. I have checked a few times that the image is correct. I have even flashed it twice: with dd and with balena etcher. Also if you know about other systems ",
