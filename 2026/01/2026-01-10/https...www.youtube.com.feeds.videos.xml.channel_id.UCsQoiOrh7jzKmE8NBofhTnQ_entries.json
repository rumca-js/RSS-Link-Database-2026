        "description": "Welcome to the fourth session of the 16-Kata series, where the focus shifts from building systems to reading people. This episode introduces a practical way to evaluate competence, both in yourself and in others, using the idea of \u201cpower levels\u201d borrowed from Dragon Ball. The core question is simple: who can actually get things done when real risk is involved, and who only talks about it.\n\nThe session explains how real competence is built through a specific pattern: believing in something, taking a visible high-risk swing, facing skepticism, and either failing cleanly or pulling it off. These attempts permanently change how the world values you. It also shows why prediction, opinion, or confidence without personal risk produces very little real status, and why one true execution, even after many failures, upgrades your access to money, talent, and opportunity.\n\nFinally, the episode breaks down why India systematically misreads competence by overvaluing niceness, humility, and conflict",
