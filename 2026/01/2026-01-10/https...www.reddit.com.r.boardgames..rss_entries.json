We are the Five Roman Heroes, and today we are here to hopefully change the way this game is played forever. Or maybe we&#39;ve lost our minds.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OGibdfVhYTEtVIrhsZ03_He9HJryydYrnQR4ls09G3s\">The Tsuronomicon</a>. It is a curated collection of almost every variant we have created for Tsuro over the past three years. We will continue to edit and add to it as we get inspired to do so, but it already contains some variants we are quite proud of and wanted to share. And we wanted to put it out there close to Tsuro&#39;s 20th anniversary, along with the new edition Calliope is publishing.</p> <p>Important note: the crown jewel of this collection is Tsurotations. This is the one that launched everything, and it&#39;s the one we would highly recommend to everyone. All other variants are play-at-your-own-risk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",

I thought, &quot;Great, we finally have a shared hobby.&quot;</p> <p>But it turns out, I might have introduced a masterpiece too early. <em>Le Havre</em> has set the bar impossibly high for him. Now, whenever I bring out any other game - ranging from light gateways to heavier titles - his reaction is always just &quot;it\u2019s okay&quot; or &quot;meh.&quot;</p> <p>I don\u2019t mind playing Le Havre, but on our game dates, I crave variety. I try to put other games on the table, and while he doesn&#39;t refuse, he clearly &quot;checks out&quot; or plays half-heartedly just to please me.

Yesterday one of the persons I played with recruited the Assassin and tried to deactivate my Watcher, as he wanted to release the other lord I had reserved with the special token. I wouldn&#39;t let him because in my view the Watcher&#39;s power is single shot, as indicated by the arrow next to the text ; once it&#39;s been activated, the only thing that matters is the token, which the Assassin can&#39;t shut down, as I already own it (&quot;For the rest of the game&quot; as the rules of the expansion explicitly state) and so it&#39;s no longer directly linked to the Watcher&#39;s written power.
