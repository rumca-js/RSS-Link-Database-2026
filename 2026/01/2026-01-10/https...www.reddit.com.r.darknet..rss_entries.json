I\u2019m thinking of swapping some BTC into Monero using zenithswap.io, storing it in a new Monero wallet, and later converting it back to BTC via ff.io. I\u2019d take precautions like using a VPN and possibly a separate device.</p> <p>Has anyone tried this just for privacy? What was your experience? Does my idea is good or there is a better one?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/natalooski\"> /u/natalooski </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1q91f6m/how_safe_is_using_xmr_for_bitcoin_privacy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1q91f6m/how_safe_is_using_xmr_for_bitcoin_privacy/\">[comments]</a></span>",
