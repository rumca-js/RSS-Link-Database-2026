After a few months, nobody remembers why it exists, but it\u2019s now part of production.</p> <p>I built a small CLI called <strong>DebtBomb</strong> to experiment with a different approach: instead of vague TODOs, temporary code gets an explicit expiry date in a comment. When that date passes, the tool reports it \u2014 and optionally fails CI \u2014 until the code is either removed or the expiry is updated.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>// debtbomb: expires 2026-02-10 \u2014 remove after experiment A </code></pre> <p>The tool just scans comments, so it\u2019s language-agnostic. It runs as a single binary and can be dropped into any CI. There\u2019s also an npm wrapper so it\u2019s easy to try in JavaScript projects.</p> <p>It\u2019s something I built because I kept seeing \u201ctem",

We got together and hacked up applications that are built on-top of the protocol. Applications we use on a daily basis to communicate with each other via voice or text. Our devices establish P2P and E2EE tunnels between each other so we can more easily hack on things together, or play old school",
