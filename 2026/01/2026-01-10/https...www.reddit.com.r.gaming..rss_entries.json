It really annoys me when people harp on a game\u2019s ability (or lack thereof) to be played every day for months and months. Not every game needs to be able to be played endlessly. It is totally acceptable for a $30 game to be good for 30 hours and then just be done. You got what there is to get out of the game and move on. No endgame, no endless grind, it\u2019s just over and you enjoyed yourself. Congrats. Time for the next game. If I get 1 hour of game time per $1 spent, that\u2019s a pretty damn good value proposition. Demanding every game be your new game for life is toxic and hurts gaming as a whole. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Trollselektor\"> /u/Trollselektor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q9fv6a/games_dont_need_to_be_forever_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q9fv6a/games_",
