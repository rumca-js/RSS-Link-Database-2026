The accumulating context from the codebase was eating through tokens fast. So I built a language designed to be generated by AI rather than written by humans.<p>GlyphLang<p>GlyphLang replaces verbose keywords with symbols that tokenize more efficiently:<p><pre><code>  # Python\n  @app.route('/users/<id>')\n  def get_user(id):\n      user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", id)\n      return jsonify(user)\n\n  # GlyphLang\n  @ GET /users/:id {\n    $ user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", id)\n    > user\n  }\n\n  @ = route, $ = variable, > = return. Initial benchmarks show ~45% fewer tokens than Python, ~63% fewer than Java.\n</code></pre>\nIn practice, that means more logic fits in context, and sessions stretch longer before hitting limits. The AI maintains a broader view of your codebase throughout.<p>Before anyone asks: no, this isn't APL with extr",

It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0].<p>My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything.<p>So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the databa",

Unlike standard chatbots, our focus is on community co-creation\u2014users define the worldviews, and our agents (with persistent memory and social relationships) bring them to life.<p>The cool part:<p>We implemented a system we call \"World-Line Divergence\" (inspired by visual novels like Steins;Gate). Usually, AI RPGs feel random or infinite loop. We built a state machine that tracks \"World Deviation.\" If players interact with NPCs in specific ways (e.g., convincing an artist to change their style), it triggers a graph switch, leading to a completely different generated ending, effectively breaking the original script.<p>Tech Stack:<p>- Backend: Python / Java with a custom AI orchestration framework (to handle agent concurrency).<p>- Models: Hybrid routing between Gemi",
